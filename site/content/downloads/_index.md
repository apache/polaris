| 1.0.0 | 7/9/2025     | [tar.gz](https://downloads.apache.org/incubator/polaris/0.9.0-incubating/apache-polaris-0.9.0-incubating.tar.gz) • [asc](https://downloads.apache.org/incubator/polaris/0.9.0-incubating/apache-polaris-0.9.0-incubating.tar.gz.asc) • [sha512](https://downloads.apache.org/incubator/polaris/0.9.0-incubating/apache-polaris-0.9.0-incubating.tar.gz.sha512) • [KEYS](https://downloads.apache.org/incubator/polaris/KEYS) |

- Highlights
    - First release ready for real-world workloads after the public beta 0.9.0
    - Binary distribution, providing a single downloadable .tgz or .zip artifact.
    - First release to officially support Helm Chart publishing, enabling seamless integration into Kubernetes-based environments.
- New features & enhancements
    - Policy Store — persistence with schema evolution, built‑in TMS policies (Data compaction, Snapshot expiry, etc) and REST CRUD endpoints
    - Postgres JDBC persistence — native JDBC backend with robust support for concurrent changes.
    - Rollback Compaction on Conflicts - Makes Polaris smarter, to revert the compaction commits in case of crunch to let the writers who are actually adding or removing the data to the table succeed. In a sense treating compaction as always a lower priority process.
    - Enhanced runtime — new runtime powered by Quarkus delivers out‑of‑the‑box Kubernetes readiness, quick startup, OIDC integration, and many other benefits. Polaris server and admin tool are now using Quarkus as a runtime framework.
    - HTTP caching via ETag — the loadTable endpoint supports ETag, reducing bandwidth and improving perceived latency
    - Support for external identity providers (IdP) — Polaris can now be its own IdP, delegate to an external IdP, or both
    - Snapshot filtering – Clients can choose to load only referenced snapshots
    - Catalog Federation (experimental) – Federate requests to an external Iceberg REST or Hadoop Catalog
    - Generic Tables (experimental) — serve multiple table formats (Delta, CSV, Parquet) besides Iceberg tables; initial Spark 3.5 plugin supports Delta Lake
    - Event Listener framework (experimental) — subscribe to catalog events (AfterTableCommitedEvent, BeforeViewCommitedEvent, etc)
- Notable bug fixes
    - CLI and Python Client improvements – Support for new features, CLI repair, changes to the update subcommand, and various fixes
    - Safe configurations – Catalog-level Polaris configurations follow a strict naming convention to avoid name clashes with user-provided configuration entries. Legacy Polaris configuration names are still supported in 1.0 to allow existing deployments to migrate without rush.
    - TableOperations optimizations – Changes to BasePolarisTableOperations result in less traffic to object storage during commits
    - Bounded entity cache – The entity cache is now more memory-aware and less likely to lead to OOMs
    - Bootstrapping fixes – Users can more easily bootstrap a new realm. Root credentials can be provided by the user or generated by Polaris (and returned to the user).
- Breaking changes
    - Server Configuration – The format used to configure the Polaris service in 0.9 has changed with the migration to Quarkus and changes to configurations
    - Bootstrap Flow – The bootstrap flow used in 0.9 has changed with the migration to Quarkus and the new admin tool
