The Apache Polaris API offers a comprehensive set of endpoints that enable you to manage principals, principal-roles, catalogs, and catalog-roles programmatically.

It follows REST standards, using clear, resource-based URLs, standard HTTP methods, response codes, and secure authentication. With the Polaris API, you can create, manage, and query Iceberg catalogs efficiently.
