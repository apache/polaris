Title: Deploying Polaris on Azure
type: docs
weight: 320
---

Build and launch Polaris using the AWS Startup Script at the location provided in the command below. This script will start an [Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/overview) instance, which will be used as the backend Postgres instance holding all Polaris data.
Additionally, Polaris will be bootstrapped to use this database and Docker containers will be spun up for Spark SQL and Trino.

The requirements to run the script below are:
* Install the AZ CLI, if it is not already installed on the Azure VM. Instructions to download the AZ CLI can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
* You must be logged into the AZ CLI. Please run `az account show` to ensure that you are logged in prior to running this script.

```shell
chmod +x getting-started/assets/cloud_providers/deploy-azure.sh
./getting-started/assets/cloud_providers/deploy-azure.sh
```

Also, set the following static credentials for interacting with the Polaris server in the following exercises: 

```shell
export CLIENT_ID=root
export CLIENT_SECRET=s3cr3t
```

To shut down the Polaris server, run the following commands:

```shell
docker compose -f getting-started/eclipselink/docker-compose.yml down
```

To deploy Polaris in a production setting, please review further recommendations at the [Configuring Polaris for Production]({{% relref "../../configuring-polaris-for-production" %}}) page.
