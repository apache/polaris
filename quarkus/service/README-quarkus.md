This module contains the Polaris Service powered by Quarkus (instead of Dropwizard).

# Main differences

* Bean injection (CDI) is made using `@ApplicationScoped` annotation on class and injected in other classes using `@Inject` annotation (https://quarkus.io/guides/cdi-reference). 
* Codehale metrics registry and opentelemetry boilerplate (prometheus exporter included) are not needed anymore: Quarkus provides it "out of the box" (https://quarkus.io/guides/opentelemetry)
* `PolarisHealthCheck` is not needed anymore: Quarkus provides it "out of the box" (https://quarkus.io/guides/smallrye-health)
* `TimedApplicationEventListener` and the `@TimedApi` annotation are replaced by Quarkus (micrometer) `@Timed` annotation (https://quarkus.io/guides/telemetry-micrometer)
* `PolarisJsonLayoutFactory` is not needed anymore: Quarkus provides it by configuration (using `quarkus.log.*` configuration)
* `PolarisApplication` is not needed, Quarkus provide a "main" application out of the box (it's possible to provide `QuarkusApplication` for control the startup and also using `@Startup` annotation)
* CORS boilerplate is not needed anymore: Quarkus supports it via configuration (using `quarkus.http.cors.*` configuration)
* CLI is not part of `polaris-service` anymore, we have (will have) a dedicated module (`polaris-cli`)

# Build and run

To build `polaris-service` you simply do:

```
./gradlew :polaris-service:build
```

The build creates ready to run package:
* in the `build/quarkus-app` folder, you can run with `java -jar quarkus-run.jar`
* the `build/distributions` folder contains tar/zip distributions you can extract  

You can directly run Polaris service (in the build scope) using:

```
./gradlew :polaris-quarkus-service:quarkusRun
```

You can run in Dev mode as well:

```
./gradlew --console=plain :polaris-quarkus-service:quarkusDev
```

You can directly build a Docker image using:

```
./gradlew :polaris-quarkus-service:imageBuild
```

# Configuration

The main configuration file is not the `application.properties`. The default configuration is
packaged as part of the `polaris-quarkus-service`. `polaris-quarkus-service` uses several 
configuration sources (in this order):
* system properties
* environment variables
* `.env` file in the current working directory
* `$PWD/config/application.properties` file
* the `application.properties` packaged in the `polaris-quarkus-service` application

It means you can override some configuration property using environment variables for example.

By default, `polaris-quarkus-service` uses 8181 as the HTTP port (defined in the `quarkus.http.port`
configuration property) and 8182 as the management port (defined in the `quarkus.management.port`
configuration property).

You can find more details here: https://quarkus.io/guides/config

# TODO

* Modify `CallContext` and remove all usages of `ThreadLocal`, replace with proper context propagation.
* Remove `PolarisCallContext` â€“ it's just an aggregation of CDI beans
* Use `@QuarkustIntegrationTest` for integration tests
* Remove `OAuthCredentialAuthFilter` and replace with Quarkus OIDC security
* Create `polaris-cli` module, add Bootstrap and Purge commands
* Adapt Helm charts, Dockerfiles, K8s examples
* Fix intermittent Gradle build error : SRCFG00011: Could not expand value
  platform.quarkus.native.builder-image in property quarkus.native.builder-image
  (https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/19139).
  The Quarkus issue says that using the Quarkus-platform bom helps (it's really what we should depend on). But   IIRC there were some dependency issues with Spark/Scala, which prevents us from using the Quarkus-platform bom.

* Update documentation/README/...

* Do we want to support existing json configuration file as configuration source ?
