| 
| Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
| document, but changing it is not allowed.
| 
| Preamble
| 
| The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
| and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
| guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
| software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to
| most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose
| authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
| covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
| your programs, too.
| 
| When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our
| General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
| distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
| that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
| the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you
| can do these things.
| 
| To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
| you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions
| translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
| software, or if you modify it.
| 
| For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for
| a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must
| make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must
| show them these terms so they know their rights.
| 
| We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
| offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
| and/or modify the software.
| 
| Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
| everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the
| software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
| know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced
| by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
| 
| Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We
| wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
| individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.
| To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for
| everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
| 
| The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
| follow.
| 
| TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
| 
| 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
| placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of
| this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to any such program
| or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
| derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
| Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
| translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included
| without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as
| "you".
| 
| Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
| this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is
| not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
| constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
| running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
| 
| 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as
| you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
| appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
| disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
| and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
| Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
| 
| You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
| at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
| 
| 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
| forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications
| or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
| these conditions:
| 
|     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
|     that you changed the files and the date of any change.
| 
|     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
|     in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
|     licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
|     this License.
| 
|     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
|     you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the
|     most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
|     appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
|     else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
|     the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy
|     of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does
|     not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is
|     not required to print an announcement.)
| 
| These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
| sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
| considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
| its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
| works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
| work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms
| of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
| whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
| 
| Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
| rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
| right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
| the Program.
| 
| In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the
| Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
| distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
| License.
| 
| 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
| Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and
| 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
| 
|     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
|     code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
|     on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
| 
|     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
|     give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
|     performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
|     corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
|     and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
| 
|     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
|     distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only
|     for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
|     object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
|     Subsection b above.)
| 
| The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
| modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all
| the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
| definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
| of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code
| distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
| source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)
| of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
| itself accompanies the executable.
| 
| If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy
| from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
| code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though
| third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
| 
| 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
| expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
| sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate
| your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
| rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
| long as such parties remain in full compliance.
| 
| 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
| However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program
| or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
| accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or
| any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to
| do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
| the Program or works based on it.
| 
| 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
| the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
| copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
| You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
| rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
| third parties to this License.
| 
| 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
| infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
| are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
| contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
| conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
| simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
| obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
| For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
| of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
| you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
| refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
| 
| If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
| particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
| the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
| 
| It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
| other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
| section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
| distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many
| people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
| distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
| system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
| distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
| choice.
| 
| This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
| consequence of the rest of this License.
| 
| 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
| countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
| copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit
| geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
| distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In
| such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body
| of this License.
| 
| 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
| General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in
| spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
| or concerns.
| 
| Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
| specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
| version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
| that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
| If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may
| choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
| 
| 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
| whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
| permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,
| write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.
| Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
| all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of
| software generally.
| 
| NO WARRANTY
| 
| 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
| THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
| STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
| PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
| INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
| FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
| PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,
| YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
| 
| 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
| ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
| PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
| GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
| INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
| BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
| FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
| OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
| 
| END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
| 
| How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
| 
| If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
| use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
| which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
| 
| To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach
| them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion
| of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a
| pointer to where the full notice is found.
| 
|     One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
| 
|     Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
| 
|     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
|     under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
|     Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)
|     any later version.
| 
|     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
|     ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or
|     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for
|     more details.
| 
|     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
|     with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59
|     Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
| 
| Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
| 
| If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it
| starts in an interactive mode:
| 
|     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes
|     with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.  This is free
|     software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;
|     type 'show c' for details.
| 
| The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate
| parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be
| called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be
| mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
| 
| You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
| if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.  Here
| is a sample; alter the names:
| 
|     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
|     'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
| 
|     signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
| 
|     Ty Coon, President of Vice
| 
| This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
| proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
| consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
| library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public
| License instead of this License.
| 
| 
| "CLASSPATH" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL
| 
| Certain source files distributed by Oracle America and/or its affiliates are
| subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but
| only where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's header
| the words "Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the "Classpath"
| exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code."
| 
|     Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making
|     a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of
|     the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.
| 
|     As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
|     permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
|     executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,
|     and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your
|     choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,
|     the terms and conditions of the license of that module.  An independent
|     module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.  If
|     you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of
|     the library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do
|     so, delete this exception statement from your version.
