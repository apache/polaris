# Getting Started with Apache Spark and Apache Polaris With Delta and Iceberg

This getting started guide provides a `docker-compose` file to set up [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) with Apache Polaris using
the new Polaris Spark Client. 

The Polaris Spark Client enables manage of both Delta and Iceberg tables using Apache Polaris.

A Jupyter notebook is started to run PySpark, and Polaris Python client is also installed to call Polaris APIs
directly through Python Client.

## Build the Spark Client Jar and Polaris image
If Spark Client Jar is not presented locally under plugins/spark/v3.5/build/<scala_version>/libs, please build the jar
using
- `./gradlew assemble` -- build the Polaris project and skip the tests.

If a Polaris image is not already present locally, build one with the following command:

```shell
./gradlew \
  :polaris-quarkus-server:assemble \
  :polaris-quarkus-server:quarkusAppPartsBuild --rerun \
  -Dquarkus.container-image.build=true
```

## Run the `docker-compose` file

To start the `docker-compose` file, run this command from the repo's root directory:
```shell
docker-compose -f plugins/spark/v3.5/getting-started/docker-compose.yml up
```

This will spin up 2 container services
* The `polaris` service for running Apache Polaris using an in-memory metastore
* The `jupyter` service for running Jupyter notebook with PySpark

NOTE: Starting the container first time may take a couple of minutes, because it will need to download the Spark 3.5.5.
When working with Delta, the Polaris Spark Client requires delta-io >= 3.2.1, and it requires at least Spark 3.5.3, 
but the current jupyter Spark image only support Spark 3.5.0.

### Run with AWS access setup
If you want to interact with S3 bucket, make sure you have the following environment variables setup correctly in
your local env before running the `docker-compose` file.
```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your_access_key>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your_secret_key>
```

## Access the Jupyter notebook interface
In the Jupyter notebook container log, look for the URL to access the Jupyter notebook. The url should be in the 
format, `http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=<token>`.

Open the Jupyter notebook in a browser.
Navigate to [`notebooks/SparkPolaris.ipynb`](http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab/tree/notebooks/SparkPolaris.ipynb) <!-- markdown-link-check-disable-line -->

If the above url doesn't work, try to replace `127.0.0.1` with `localhost`, for example:
`http://localhost:8888/lab?token=<token>`.

## Run the Jupyter notebook
You can now run all cells in the notebook or write your own code!
