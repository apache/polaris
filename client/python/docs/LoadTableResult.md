# LoadTableResult

Result used when a table is successfully loaded.   The table metadata JSON is returned in the `metadata` field. The corresponding file location of table metadata should be returned in the `metadata-location` field, unless the metadata is not yet committed. For example, a create transaction may return metadata that is staged but not committed. Clients can check whether metadata has changed by comparing metadata locations after the table has been created.   The `config` map returns table-specific configuration for the table's resources, including its HTTP client and FileIO. For example, config may contain a specific FileIO implementation class for the table depending on its underlying storage.   The following configurations should be respected by clients:  ## General Configurations  - `token`: Authorization bearer token to use for table requests if OAuth2 security is enabled   ## AWS Configurations  The following configurations should be respected when working with tables stored in AWS S3  - `client.region`: region to configure client for making requests to AWS  - `s3.access-key-id`: id for for credentials that provide access to the data in S3  - `s3.secret-access-key`: secret for credentials that provide access to data in S3   - `s3.session-token`: if present, this value should be used for as the session token   - `s3.remote-signing-enabled`: if `true` remote signing should be performed as described in the `s3-signer-open-api.yaml` specification 

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**metadata_location** | **str** | May be null if the table is staged as part of a transaction | [optional] 
**metadata** | [**TableMetadata**](TableMetadata.md) |  | 
**config** | **Dict[str, str]** |  | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from polaris.catalog.models.load_table_result import LoadTableResult

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of LoadTableResult from a JSON string
load_table_result_instance = LoadTableResult.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(LoadTableResult.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
load_table_result_dict = load_table_result_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of LoadTableResult from a dict
load_table_result_from_dict = LoadTableResult.from_dict(load_table_result_dict)
