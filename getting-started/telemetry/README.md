# Getting Started with Apache Polaris, Prometheus and Jaeger

This example requires `jq` to be installed on your machine.

1. Build the Polaris image if it's not already present locally:

    ```shell
    ./gradlew clean :polaris-quarkus-server:assemble -Dquarkus.container-image.build=true --no-build-cache
    ```

2. Start the docker compose group by running the following command from the root of the repository:

    ```shell
    docker compose -f getting-started/telemetry/docker-compose.yml up
    ```

3. To access Polaris from the host machine, first request an access token:

    ```shell
    export POLARIS_TOKEN=$(curl -s http://polaris:8181/api/catalog/v1/oauth/tokens \
       --resolve polaris:8181:127.0.0.1 \
       --user root:s3cr3t \
       -d 'grant_type=client_credentials' \
       -d 'scope=PRINCIPAL_ROLE:ALL' | jq -r .access_token)
    ```

4. Then, use the access token in the Authorization header when accessing Polaris; you can also test
   the `Polairs-Request-Id` header; you should see it in all logs and traces:

    ```shell
    curl -v http://127.0.0.1:8181/api/management/v1/principal-roles \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $POLARIS_TOKEN" \
      -H "Polaris-Request-Id: 1234"
    curl -v http://127.0.0.1:8181/api/catalog/v1/config?warehouse=polaris_demo \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $POLARIS_TOKEN" \
      -H "Polaris-Request-Id: 5678"
    ```

5. Access the following services:

   - Prometheus UI: browse to http://localhost:9093 to view metrics.
   - Jaeger UI: browse to http://localhost:16686 to view traces.
