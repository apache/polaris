# Getting Started with Apache Polaris and MinIO

## Overview

This example uses MinIO as a storage provider with Polaris.

Spark is used as a query engine. This example assumes a local Spark installation.
See the [Spark Notebooks Example](../spark/README.md) for a more advanced Spark setup.

## Starting the Example

1. Build the Polaris server image if it's not already present locally:

    ```shell
    ./gradlew \
       :polaris-server:assemble \
       :polaris-server:quarkusAppPartsBuild --rerun \
       -Dquarkus.container-image.build=true
    ```

2. Start the docker compose group by running the following command from the root of the repository:

    ```shell
    docker compose -f getting-started/minio/docker-compose.yml up
    ```

## Connecting From Spark

```shell
bin/spark-sql \
    --packages org.apache.iceberg:iceberg-spark-runtime-3.5_2.12:1.9.0,org.apache.iceberg:iceberg-aws-bundle:1.9.0 \
    --conf spark.sql.extensions=org.apache.iceberg.spark.extensions.IcebergSparkSessionExtensions \
    --conf spark.sql.catalog.polaris=org.apache.iceberg.spark.SparkCatalog \
    --conf spark.sql.catalog.polaris.type=rest \
    --conf spark.sql.catalog.polaris.uri=http://localhost:8181/api/catalog \
    --conf spark.sql.catalog.polaris.token-refresh-enabled=false \
    --conf spark.sql.catalog.polaris.warehouse=quickstart_catalog \
    --conf spark.sql.catalog.polaris.scope=PRINCIPAL_ROLE:ALL \
    --conf spark.sql.catalog.polaris.header.X-Iceberg-Access-Delegation=vended-credentials \
    --conf spark.sql.catalog.polaris.credential=root:s3cr3t \
    --conf spark.sql.catalog.polaris.client.region=irrelevant
```

Note: `s3cr3t` is defined as the password for the `root` users in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

Note: The `client.region` configuration is required for the AWS S3 client to work, but it is not used in this example
since MinIO does not require a specific region.

## Running Queries

Run inside the Spark SQL shell:

```
spark-sql (default)> use polaris;
Time taken: 0.837 seconds

spark-sql ()> create namespace ns;
Time taken: 0.374 seconds

spark-sql ()> create table ns.t1 as select 'abc';
Time taken: 2.192 seconds

spark-sql ()> select * from ns.t1;
abc
Time taken: 0.579 seconds, Fetched 1 row(s)
```

## MinIO Endpoints

Note that the catalog configuration defined in the `docker-compose.yml` contains
different endpoints for the Polaris Server and the client (Spark). Specifically,
the client endpoint is `http://localhost:9000`, but `endpointInternal` is `http://minio:9000`.

This is necessary because clients running on `localhost` do not normally see service
names (such as `minio`) that are internal to the docker compose environment.
