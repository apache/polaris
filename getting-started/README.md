# Getting Started with Apache Polaris

You can quickly get started with Polaris by playing with the docker-compose examples provided in
this directory. Each example has detailed instructions.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) 
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) (for some examples)

## Getting Started Examples

- [Spark](spark): An example that uses an in-memory metastore, automatically bootstrapped, with
  Apache Spark and a Jupyter notebook.

- [Trino](trino): An example that uses Trino with Polaris.

- [Telemetry](telemetry): An example that includes Prometheus and Jaeger to collect metrics and
  traces from Apache Polaris. This example automatically creates a `polaris_demo` catalog.

- [Eclipselink](eclipselink): An example that uses an Eclipselink metastore and a Postgres
  database. The realm is bootstrapped with the Polaris Admin tool. This example also creates a
  `polaris_demo` catalog, and offers the ability to run Spark SQL queries. Finally, it shows how to
  attach a debugger to the Polaris server.
