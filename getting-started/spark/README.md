# Getting Started with Apache Spark and Apache Polaris

This getting started guide provides a `docker-compose` file to set up [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) with Apache Polaris. Apache Polaris is configured as an Iceberg REST Catalog in Spark. 
A Jupyter notebook is used to run PySpark.

## Build the Polaris image

If a Polaris image is not already present locally, build one with the following command:

```shell
./gradlew clean :polaris-quarkus-server:assemble -Dquarkus.container-image.build=true --no-build-cache
```

## Run the `docker-compose` file

To start the `docker-compose` file, run this command from the repo's root directory:
```shell
docker-compose -f getting-started/spark/docker-compose.yml up
```

This will spin up 2 container services
* The `polaris` service for running Apache Polaris using an in-memory metastore
* The `jupyter` service for running Jupyter notebook with PySpark

## Access the Jupyter notebook interface
In the Jupyter notebook container log, look for the URL to access the Jupyter notebook. The url should be in the format, `http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=<token>`.

Open the Jupyter notebook in a browser.
Navigate to [`notebooks/SparkPolaris.ipynb`](http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab/tree/notebooks/SparkPolaris.ipynb) <!-- markdown-link-check-disable-line -->

## Run the Jupyter notebook
You can now run all cells in the notebook or write your own code!
