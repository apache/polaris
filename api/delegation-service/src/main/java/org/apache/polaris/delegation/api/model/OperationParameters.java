/**
 * Base class for operation-specific parameters in delegation tasks.
 *
 * <p>This abstract class serves as the base for all operation-specific parameter types. Each
 * concrete subclass represents parameters for a specific type of delegation operation, providing
 * type safety and clear separation of concerns.
 *
 * <p>Uses Jackson polymorphism to serialize/deserialize different parameter types based on the
 * operation type. This allows the API to handle different parameter structures while maintaining
 * type safety.
 *
 * <p><strong>Supported Operation Types:</strong>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link TablePurgeParameters} - For TABLE_PURGE operations
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>Adding New Operation Types:</strong>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Create a new concrete subclass extending {@code OperationParameters}
 *   <li>Add the subclass to the {@link JsonSubTypes} annotation
 *   <li>Define the operation-specific fields and validation
 * </ol>
