As AI and other data-hungry use cases infiltrate the market, the need for a comprehensive data catalog solution with governance in mind has become critical. Apache Polaris has found its calling as an open-source solution, specifically built to handle data governed by Apache Iceberg, that is changing the way we manage and access data across various clouds, formats, and platforms.</description></item><item><title>Apache Polaris 1.1.0-incubating has been released!</title><link>https://polaris.apache.org/blog/2025/09/19/apache-polaris-1.1.0-incubating-has-been-released/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://polaris.apache.org/blog/2025/09/19/apache-polaris-1.1.0-incubating-has-been-released/</guid><description>The Apache Polaris team is pleased to announce Apache Polaris 1.1.0-incubating.

Apache Polaris, as an open and standardized REST Catalog service for Iceberg, provides an ideal solution to this challenge. It not only handles centralized metadata management but also significantly enhances data lake security and manageability through fine-grained access control and flexible credential management mechanisms.</description></item><item><title>Apache Polaris 1.0.1-incubating has been released!</title><link>https://polaris.apache.org/blog/2025/08/20/apache-polaris-1.0.1-incubating-has-been-released/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://polaris.apache.org/blog/2025/08/20/apache-polaris-1.0.1-incubating-has-been-released/</guid><description>The Apache Polaris team is pleased to announce Apache Polaris 1.0.1-incubating.
