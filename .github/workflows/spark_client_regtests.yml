      # NOTE: the regression test runs with spark 3.5.5 and scala 2.12 in Java 17. We also have integration
      # tests runs with the existing gradle.yml, which only runs on Java 21. Since spark Java compatibility
      # for 3.5 is 8, 11, and 17, we should run spark client with those compatible java versions.
      # TODO: add separate spark client CI and run with Java 8, 11 and 17.
