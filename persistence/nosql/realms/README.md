# Dynamic realm management

Framework to manage realms.

## Code structure

The code is structured into multiple modules. Consuming code should almost always pull in only the API module.

* `polaris-realms-api` provides the necessary Java interfaces and immutable types.
* `polaris-realms-id` provides a type-safe holder for a realm ID.
* `polaris-realms-impl` provides the storage agnostic implementation.
* `polaris-realms-spi` provides the necessary interfaces to provide a storage specific implementation.
* `polaris-realms-store-nosql` provides the storage implementation based on `polaris-persistence-nosql-api`.
