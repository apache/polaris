# Apache Polaris - Project Chat Bylaws

Apache Polaris is currently undergoing Incubation at the Apache Software Foundation.

## Motivation

The Polaris project uses a public and open chat service currently provided by Zulip hosted
at https://polaris-catalog.zulipchat.com/. A few rules shall ensure that the chat conforms to the rules and best
practices of the Apache Software Foundation and serves well as a collaboration tool for the project.

Organizations and other open-source projects that contribute continuously and significantly to Polaris are welcome, but
shall not use the Polaris chat as a vehicle for their own marketing without explicit approval of the project (P)PMC.

## Code of Conduct

The [Apache Software Foundation’s Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html) applies to
the Polaris project public chat.

## Governance

* The Polaris project’s chat tool is not provided by the ASF - the Polaris project (P)PMC members govern and monitor the
  chat service.
* Everybody is welcome to join the Polaris project chat. Invites are not needed.
* All users are automatically promoted to “members” (don’t stay in “guests”).
* Polaris project (P)PMC members have “owner” privileges on the Zulip chat. Polaris project committers are granted
  “moderator” or “administrator” privileges for moderation purposes.
* This bylaws document shall be published on the project’s web site and linked from relevant public channels.
* Only (P)PMC members are allowed to create new channels. The number of channels shall be limited to #general (user
  discussions), #dev (development discussions), #announcements (release announcements), and #noise (GitHub feed).
* Only (P)PMC members are allowed to notify a large number of users (aka @here).

## 3rd Parties

Definition: “3rd party” means any (other) open-source project or any commercial vendor or any other organization.

### 3rd Party Channels

* 3rd parties who contribute to or use the Polaris project may ask the (P)PMC to get a dedicated public channel, for
  example #vendor-<vendor-name> or #project-<project-name>.
* Promotion of 3rd party content is only permitted in these 3rd party channels, and only if the content primarily covers
  Polaris. Commercial advertisements in any form are prohibited.
* Interaction with users of 3rd party OSS projects or commercial products should be directed to these 3rd party
  channels.

## Content moderation

* Any content which violates the Apache “Code of Conduct” will be removed.
* Any commercial advertisements will be removed.
* All other content will not be moderated.
