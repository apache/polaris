# ---- CLI Profile Configuration ----
# This file is automatically loaded when running with -Dquarkus.profile=cli
# It contains configuration specific to the Polaris Admin CLI commands
#
# WARNING: Only RUNTIME configuration properties are allowed in this profile file!
# Build-time properties (those marked as "fixed at build-time" in Quarkus docs) MUST be
# defined in the base application.properties file. Profile-specific files like this one
# can only override runtime configuration values.
#
# Setting build-time properties here will have NO EFFECT since the profile is activated
# after the application has already been built. Build-time properties are baked into the
# application during the build phase and cannot be changed at runtime.
#
