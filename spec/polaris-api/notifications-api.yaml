        summary: Sends a notification to the table
        operationId: sendNotification
        requestBody:
          description:
            The request containing the notification to be sent.
          
            For each table, Polaris will reject any notification where the timestamp in the request body
            is older than or equal to the most recent time Polaris has already processed for the table.
            The responsibility of ensuring the correct order of timestamps for a sequence of notifications 
            lies with the caller of the API. This includes managing potential clock skew or inconsistencies 
            when notifications are sent from multiple sources.

            A VALIDATE request behaves like a dry-run of a CREATE or UPDATE request up to but not including
            loading the contents of a metadata file; this includes validations of permissions, the specified
            metadata path being within ALLOWED_LOCATIONS, having an EXTERNAL catalog, etc. The intended use
            case for a VALIDATE notification is to allow a remote catalog to pre-validate the general
            settings of a receiving catalog against an intended new table location before possibly creating
            a table intended for sending notifications in the remote catalog at all. For a VALIDATE request,
            the specified metadata-location can either be a prospective full metadata file path, or a
            relevant parent directory of the intended table to validate against ALLOWED_LOCATIONS.
