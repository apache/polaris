Before proceeding with Polaris, be sure to satisfy the relevant prerequisites listed here.\n\n### Building and Deploying Polaris\n\nTo get the latest Polaris code, you'll need to clone the repository using [git](https://git-scm.com/). You can install git using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/):\n\n```shell\nbrew install git\n```\n\nThen, use git to clone the Polaris repo:\n\n```shell\ncd ~\ngit clone https://github.com/apache/polaris.git\n```\n\n#### With Docker\n\nIf you plan to deploy Polaris inside [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), you'll need to install docker itself. For example, this can be done using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/):\n\n```shell\nbrew install --cask docker\n```\n\nOnce installed, make sure Docker is running.\n\n#### From Source\n\nIf you plan to build Polaris from source yourself, you will need to satisfy a few prerequisites first.\n\nPolaris is built using [gradle](https://gradle.org/) and is compatible with Java 21. We recommend the use of [jenv](https://www.jenv.be/) to manage multiple Java versions. For example, to install Java 21 via [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and configure it with jenv: \n\n```shell\ncd ~/polaris\nbrew install openjdk@21 jenv\njenv add $(brew --prefix openjdk@21)\njenv local 21\n```\n\n### Connecting to Polaris\n\nPolaris is compatible with any [Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/) client that supports the REST API. Depending on the client you plan to use, refer to the prerequisites below.\n\n#### With Spark\n\nIf you want to connect to Polaris with [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), you'll need to start by cloning Spark. As [above](#building-and-deploying-polaris), make sure [git](https://git-scm.com/) is installed first. You can install it with [homebrew](https://brew.sh/):\n\n```shell\nbrew install git\n```\n\nThen, clone Spark and check out a versioned branch. This guide uses [Spark 3.5](https://spark.apache.org/releases/spark-release-3-5-0.html).\n\n```shell\ncd ~\ngit clone https://github.com/apache/spark.git\ncd ~/spark\ngit checkout branch-3.5\n```\n\n## Deploying Polaris\n\nPolaris can be deployed via a lightweight docker image or as a standalone process. Before starting, be sure that you've satisfied the relevant [prerequisites](#building-and-deploying-polaris) detailed above.\n\n### Docker Image\n\nTo start using Polaris in Docker, launch Polaris while Docker is running:\n\n```shell\ncd ~/polaris\ndocker compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build\n```\n\nOnce the `polaris-polaris` container is up, you can continue to [Defining a Catalog](#defining-a-catalog).\n\n### Building Polaris\n\nRun Polaris locally with:\n\n```shell\ncd ~/polaris\n./gradlew runApp\n```\n\nYou should see output for some time as Polaris builds and starts up. Eventually, you won’t see any more logs and should see messages that resemble the following:\n\n```\nINFO  [...] [main] [] o.e.j.s.handler.ContextHandler: Started i.d.j.MutableServletContextHandler@...\nINFO  [...] [main] [] o.e.j.server.AbstractConnector: Started application@...\nINFO  [...] [main] [] o.e.j.server.AbstractConnector: Started admin@...\nINFO  [...] [main] [] o.eclipse.jetty.server.Server: Started Server@...\n```\n\nAt this point, Polaris is running.\n\n## Bootstrapping Polaris\n\nFor this tutorial, we'll launch an instance of Polaris that stores entities only in-memory. This means that any entities that you define will be destroyed when Polaris is shut down. It also means that Polaris will automatically bootstrap itself with root credentials. For more information on how to configure Polaris for production usage, see the [docs](./configuring-polaris-for-production.md).\n\nWhen Polaris is launched using in-memory mode the root principal credentials can be found in stdout on initial startup. For example:\n\n```\nrealm: default-realm root principal credentials: <client-id>:<client-secret>\n```\n\nBe sure to note of these credentials as we'll be using them below. You can also set these credentials as environment variables for use with the Polaris CLI:\n\n```shell\nexport CLIENT_ID=<client-id> \nexport CLIENT_SECRET=<client-secret>\n```\n\n## Defining a Catalog\n\nIn Polaris, the [catalog](./entities.md#catalog) is the top-level entity that objects like [tables](./entities.md#table) and [views](./entities.md#view) are organized under. With a Polaris service running, you can create a catalog like so:\n\n```shell\ncd ~/polaris\n\n./polaris \\\n  --client-id ${CLIENT_ID} \\\n  --client-secret ${CLIENT_SECRET} \\\n  catalogs \\\n  create \\\n  --storage-type s3 \\\n  --default-base-location ${DEFAULT_BASE_LOCATION} \\\n  --role-arn ${ROLE_ARN} \\\n  quickstart_catalog\n```\n\nThis will create a new catalog called **quickstart_catalog**.\n\nThe `DEFAULT_BASE_LOCATION` you provide will be the default location that objects in this catalog should be stored in, and the `ROLE_ARN` you provide should be a [Role ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference-arns.html) with access to read and write data in that location. These credentials will be provided to engines reading data from the catalog once they have authenticated with Polaris using credentials that have access to those resources.\n\nIf you’re using a storage type other than S3, such as Azure, you’ll provide a different type of credential than a Role ARN. For more details on supported storage types, see the [docs](./entities.md#storage-type).\n\nAdditionally, if Polaris is running somewhere other than `localhost:8181`, you can specify the correct hostname and port by providing `--host` and `--port` flags. For the full set of options supported by the CLI, please refer to the [docs](./command-line-interface.md).\n\n\n### Creating a Principal and Assigning it Privileges\n\nWith a catalog created, we can create a [principal](./entities.md#principal) that has access to manage that catalog. For details on how to configure the Polaris CLI, see [the section above](#defining-a-catalog) or refer to the [docs](./command-line-interface.md).\n\n```shell\n./polaris \\\n  --client-id ${CLIENT_ID} \\\n  --client-secret ${CLIENT_SECRET} \\\n  principals \\\n  create \\\n  quickstart_user\n\n./polaris \\\n  --client-id ${CLIENT_ID} \\\n  --client-secret ${CLIENT_SECRET} \\\n  principal-roles \\\n  create \\\n  quickstart_user_role\n\n./polaris \\\n  --client-id ${CLIENT_ID} \\\n  --client-secret ${CLIENT_SECRET} \\\n  catalog-roles \\\n  create \\\n  --catalog quickstart_catalog \\\n  quickstart_catalog_role\n```\n\nBe sure to provide the necessary credentials, hostname, and port as before.\n\nWhen the `principals create` command completes successfully, it will return the credentials for this new principal. Be sure to note these down for later. For example:\n\n```\n./polaris ... principals create example\n{\"clientId\": \"XXXX\", \"clientSecret\": \"YYYY\"}\n```\n\nNow, we grant the principal the [principal role](./entities.md#principal-role) we created, and grant the [catalog role](./entities.md#catalog-role) the principal role we created. For more information on these entities, please refer to the linked documentation.\n\n```shell\n./polaris \\\n  --client-id ${CLIENT_ID} \\\n  --client-secret ${CLIENT_SECRET} \\\n  principal-roles \\\n  grant \\\n  --principal quickstart_user \\\n  quickstart_user_role\n\n./polaris \\\n  --client-id ${CLIENT_ID} \\\n  --client-secret ${CLIENT_SECRET} \\\n  catalog-roles \\\n  grant \\\n  --catalog quickstart_catalog \\\n  --principal-role quickstart_user_role \\\n  quickstart_catalog_role\n```\n\nNow, we’ve linked our principal to the catalog via roles like so:\n\n![Principal to Catalog](./img/quickstart/privilege-illustration-1.png \"Principal to Catalog\")\n\nIn order to give this principal the ability to interact with the catalog, we must assign some [privileges](./entities.md#privilege). For the time being, we will give this principal the ability to fully manage content in our new catalog. We can do this with the CLI like so:\n\n```shell\n./polaris \\\n  --client-id ${CLIENT_ID} \\\n  --client-secret ${CLIENT_SECRET} \\\n  privileges \\\n  catalog \\\n  grant \\\n  --catalog quickstart_catalog \\\n  --catalog-role quickstart_catalog_role \\\n  CATALOG_MANAGE_CONTENT\n```\n\nThis grants the [catalog privileges](./entities.md#privilege) `CATALOG_MANAGE_CONTENT` to our catalog role, linking everything together like so:\n\n![Principal to Catalog with Catalog Role](./img/quickstart/privilege-illustration-2.png \"Principal to Catalog with Catalog Role\")\n\n`CATALOG_MANAGE_CONTENT` has create/list/read/write privileges on all entities within the catalog. The same privilege could be granted to a namespace, in which case the principal could create/list/read/write any entity under that namespace.\n\n## Using Iceberg & Polaris\n\nAt this point, we’ve created a principal and granted it the ability to manage a catalog. We can now use an external engine to assume that principal, access our catalog, and store data in that catalog using [Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/).\n\n### Connecting with Spark\n\nTo use a Polaris-managed catalog in [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), we can configure Spark to use the Iceberg catalog REST API.\n\nThis guide uses [Apache Spark 3.5](https://spark.apache.org/releases/spark-release-3-5-0.html), but be sure to find [the appropriate iceberg-spark package for your Spark version](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.iceberg/iceberg-spark). From a local Spark clone on the `branch-3.5` branch we can run the following:\n\n_Note: the credentials provided here are those for our principal, not the root credentials._\n\n```shell\nbin/spark-shell \\\n--packages org.apache.iceberg:iceberg-spark-runtime-3.5_2.12:1.5.2,org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-aws:3.4.0 \\\n--conf spark.sql.extensions=org.apache.iceberg.spark.extensions.IcebergSparkSessionExtensions \\\n--conf spark.sql.catalog.quickstart_catalog.warehouse=quickstart_catalog \\\n--conf spark.sql.catalog.quickstart_catalog.header.X-Iceberg-Access-Delegation=vended-credentials \\\n--conf spark.sql.catalog.quickstart_catalog=org.apache.iceberg.spark.SparkCatalog \\\n--conf spark.sql.catalog.quickstart_catalog.catalog-impl=org.apache.iceberg.rest.RESTCatalog \\\n--conf spark.sql.catalog.quickstart_catalog.uri=http://localhost:8181/api/catalog \\\n--conf spark.sql.catalog.quickstart_catalog.credential='XXXX:YYYY' \\\n--conf spark.sql.catalog.quickstart_catalog.scope='PRINCIPAL_ROLE:ALL' \\\n--conf spark.sql.catalog.quickstart_catalog.token-refresh-enabled=true\n```\n\n\nReplace `XXXX` and `YYYY` with the client ID and client secret generated when you created the `quickstart_user` principal.\n\nSimilar to the CLI commands above, this configures Spark to use the Polaris running at `localhost:8181`. If your Polaris server is running elsewhere, but sure to update the configuration appropriately.\n\nFinally, note that we include the `hadoop-aws` package here. If your table is using a different filesystem, be sure to include the appropriate dependency.\n\nOnce the Spark session starts, we can create a namespace and table within the catalog:\n\n```\nspark.sql(\"USE quickstart_catalog\")\nspark.sql(\"CREATE NAMESPACE IF NOT EXISTS quickstart_namespace\")\nspark.sql(\"CREATE NAMESPACE IF NOT EXISTS quickstart_namespace.schema\")\nspark.sql(\"USE NAMESPACE quickstart_namespace.schema\")\nspark.sql(\"\"\"\n\tCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS quickstart_table (\n\t\tid BIGINT, data STRING\n\t) \nUSING ICEBERG\n\"\"\")\n```\n\nWe can now use this table like any other:\n\n```\nspark.sql(\"INSERT INTO quickstart_table VALUES (1, 'some data')\")\nspark.sql(\"SELECT * FROM quickstart_table\").show(false)\n. . .\n+---+---------+\n|id |data     |\n+---+---------+\n|1  |some data|\n+---+---------+\n```\n\nIf at any time access is revoked...\n\n```shell\n./polaris \\\n  --client-id ${CLIENT_ID} \\\n  --client-secret ${CLIENT_SECRET} \\\n  privileges \\\n  catalog \\\n  revoke \\\n  --catalog quickstart_catalog \\\n  --catalog-role quickstart_catalog_role \\\n  CATALOG_MANAGE_CONTENT\n```\n\nSpark will lose access to the table:\n\n```\nspark.sql(\"SELECT * FROM quickstart_table\").show(false)\n\norg.apache.iceberg.exceptions.ForbiddenException: Forbidden: Principal 'quickstart_user' with activated PrincipalRoles '[]' and activated ids '[6, 7]' is not authorized for op LOAD_TABLE_WITH_READ_DELEGATION\n```\n"

      Apache Polaris (Incubating) is a catalog implementation for Apache
      Iceberg&trade; tables and is built on the open source Apache
      Iceberg&trade; REST protocol.


      With Polaris, you can provide centralized, secure read and write access to
      your Iceberg tables across different REST-compatible query engines.


      ![Conceptual diagram of Apache Polaris (Incubating).](img/overview.svg
      "Apache Polaris (Incubating) overview")


      ## Key concepts


      This section introduces key concepts associated with using Apache Polaris
      (Incubating).


      In the following diagram, a sample [Apache Polaris (Incubating)
      structure](overview.md#catalog) with nested
      [namespaces](overview.md#namespace) is shown for Catalog1. No tables

      or namespaces have been created yet for Catalog2 or Catalog3.


      ![Diagram that shows an example Apache Polaris (Incubating)
      structure.](img/sample-catalog-structure.svg "Sample Apache Polaris
      (Incubating) structure")


      ### Catalog


      In Polaris, you can create one or more catalog resources to organize
      Iceberg tables.


      Configure your catalog by setting values in the storage configuration for
      S3, Azure, or Google Cloud Storage. An Iceberg catalog enables a

      query engine to manage and organize tables. The catalog forms the first
      architectural layer in the [Apache Iceberg&trade; table
      specification](https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/#overview) and must support
      the following tasks:


      - Storing the current metadata pointer for one or more Iceberg tables. A
      metadata pointer maps a table name to the location of that table's
          current metadata file.

      - Performing atomic operations so that you can update the current metadata
      pointer for a table to the metadata pointer of a new version of
        the table.

      To learn more about Iceberg catalogs, see the [Apache Iceberg&trade;
      documentation](https://iceberg.apache.org/concepts/catalog/).


      #### Catalog types


      A catalog can be one of the following two types:


      - Internal: The catalog is managed by Polaris. Tables from this catalog
      can be read and written in Polaris.


      - External: The catalog is externally managed by another Iceberg catalog
      provider (for example, Snowflake, Glue, Dremio Arctic). Tables from 
        this catalog are synced to Polaris. These tables are read-only in Polaris. In the current release, only a Snowflake external catalog is provided.

      A catalog is configured with a storage configuration that can point to S3,
      Azure storage, or GCS.


      ### Namespace


      You create *namespaces* to logically group Iceberg tables within a
      catalog. A catalog can have multiple namespaces. You can also create

      nested namespaces. Iceberg tables belong to namespaces.


      ### Apache Iceberg&trade; tables and catalogs


      In an internal catalog, an Iceberg table is registered in Polaris, but
      read and written via query engines. The table data and

      metadata is stored in your external cloud storage. The table uses Polaris
      as the Iceberg catalog.


      If you have tables that use Snowflake as the Iceberg catalog
      (Snowflake-managed tables), you can sync these tables to an external

      catalog in Polaris. If you sync this catalog to Polaris, it appears as an
      external catalog in Polaris. The table data and

      metadata is stored in your external cloud storage. The Snowflake query
      engine can read from or write to these tables. However, the other query

      engines can only read from these tables.


      > **Important**

      >

      > For the access privileges defined for a catalog to be enforced
      correctly, the following conditions must be met:

      >

      > - The directory only contains the data files that belong to a single
      table.

      > - The directory hierarchy matches the namespace hierarchy for the
      catalog.

      >

      > For example, if a catalog includes the following items:

      >

      > - Top-level namespace namespace1

      > - Nested namespace namespace1a

      > - A customers table, which is grouped under nested namespace namespace1a

      > - An orders table, which is grouped under nested namespace namespace1a

      >

      > The directory hierarchy for the catalog must follow this structure:

      >

      > - /namespace1/namespace1a/customers/<files for the customers table
      *only*>

      > - /namespace1/namespace1a/orders/<files for the orders table *only*>


      ### Service principal


      A service principal is an entity that you create in Polaris. Each service
      principal encapsulates credentials that you use to connect

      to Polaris.


      Query engines use service principals to connect to catalogs.


      Polaris generates a Client ID and Client Secret pair for each service
      principal.


      The following table displays example service principals that you might
      create in Polaris:

        | Service connection name     | Purpose |
        | --------------------------- | ----------- |
        |  Flink ingestion            | For Apache Flink&reg; to ingest streaming data into Apache Iceberg&trade; tables. |
        |  Spark ETL pipeline         | For Apache Spark&trade; to run ETL pipeline jobs on Iceberg tables. |
        |  Snowflake data pipelines   | For Snowflake to run data pipelines for transforming data in Apache Iceberg&trade; tables.  |
        |  Trino BI dashboard         | For Trino to run BI queries for powering a dashboard. |
        |  Snowflake AI team          | For Snowflake to run AI jobs on data in Apache Iceberg&trade; tables. |

      ### Service connection


      A service connection represents a REST-compatible engine (such as Apache
      Spark&trade;, Apache Flink&reg;, or Trino) that can read from and write to
      Polaris

      Catalog. When creating a new service connection, the Polaris administrator
      grants the service principal that is created with the new service 

      connection either a new or existing principal role. A principal role is a
      resource in Polaris that you can use to logically group Polaris 

      service principals together and grant privileges on securable objects. For
      more information, see [Principal role](access-control.md#principal-role
      "Principal role"). Polaris uses a role-based access control (RBAC) model
      to grant service principals access to resources. For more information, 

      see [Access control](access-control.md "Access control"). For a diagram of
      this model, see [RBAC model](access-control.md#rbac-model "RBAC model").


      If the Polaris administrator grants the service principal for the new
      service connection a new principal role, the service principal

      doesn't have any privileges granted to it yet. When securing the catalog
      that the new service connection will connect to, the Polaris

      administrator grants privileges to catalog roles and then grants these
      catalog roles to the new principal role. As a result, the service

      principal for the new service connection has these privileges. For more
      information about catalog roles, see [Catalog
      role](access-control.md#catalog-role "Catalog role").


      If the Polaris administrator grants an existing principal role to the
      service principal for the new service connection, the service principal

      has the same privileges granted to the catalog roles that are granted to
      the existing principal role. If needed, the Polaris

      administrator can grant additional catalog roles to the existing principal
      role or remove catalog roles from it to adjust the privileges

      bestowed to the service principal. For an example of how RBAC works in
      Polaris, see [RBAC example](access-control.md#rbac-example "RBAC
      example").


      ### Storage configuration


      A storage configuration stores a generated identity and access management
      (IAM) entity for your external cloud storage and is created

      when you create a catalog. The storage configuration is used to set the
      values to connect Polaris to your cloud storage. During the

      catalog creation process, an IAM entity is generated and used to create a
      trust relationship between the cloud storage provider and Polaris

      Catalog.


      When you create a catalog, you supply the following information about your
      external cloud storage:


      | Cloud storage provider | Information |

      | -----------------------| ----------- |

      | Amazon S3 | <ul><li>Default base location for your Amazon S3
      bucket</li><li>Locations for your Amazon S3 bucket</li><li>S3 role
      ARN</li><li>External ID (optional)</li></ul> |

      | Google Cloud Storage (GCS) | <ul><li>Default base location for your GCS
      bucket</li><li>Locations for your GCS bucket</li></ul> |

      | Azure | <ul><li>Default base location for your Microsoft Azure
      container</li><li>Locations for your Microsoft Azure
      container</li><li>Azure tenant ID</li></ul> |


      ## Example workflow


      In the following example workflow, Bob creates an Apache Iceberg&trade;
      table named Table1 and Alice reads data from Table1.


      1.  Bob uses Apache Spark&trade; to create the Table1 table under the
          Namespace1 namespace in the Catalog1 catalog and insert values into
          Table1.

          Bob can create Table1 and insert data into it because he is using a
          service connection with a service principal that has
          the privileges to perform these actions.

      2.  Alice uses Snowflake to read data from Table1.

          Alice can read data from Table1 because she is using a service
          connection with a service principal with a catalog integration that
          has the privileges to perform this action. Alice
          creates an unmanaged table in Snowflake to read data from Table1.

      ![Diagram that shows an example workflow for Apache Polaris
      (Incubating)](img/example-workflow.svg "Example workflow for Apache
      Polaris (Incubating)")


      ## Security and access control


      This section describes security and access control.


      ### Credential vending


      To secure interactions with service connections, Polaris vends temporary
      storage credentials to the query engine during query

      execution. These credentials allow the query engine to run the query
      without requiring access to your external cloud storage for

      Iceberg tables. This process is called credential vending.


      ### Identity and access management (IAM)


      Polaris uses the identity and access management (IAM) entity to securely
      connect to your storage for accessing table data, Iceberg

      metadata, and manifest files that store the table schema, partitions, and
      other metadata. Polaris retains the IAM entity for your

      storage location.


      ### Access control


      Polaris enforces the access control that you configure across all tables
      registered with the service and governs security for all

      queries from query engines in a consistent manner.


      Polaris uses a role-based access control (RBAC) model that lets you
      centrally configure access for Polaris service principals to catalogs,

      namespaces, and tables.


      Polaris RBAC uses two different role types to delegate privileges:


      - **Principal roles:** Granted to Polaris service principals and
        analogous to roles in other access control systems that you grant to
        service principals.

      - **Catalog roles:** Configured with certain privileges on Polaris
        catalog resources and granted to principal roles.

      For more information, see [Access control](access-control.md "Access
      control").

      This page documents various entities that can be managed in Apache Polaris
      (Incubating).


      ## Catalog


      A catalog is a top-level entity in Polaris that may contain other entities
      like [namespaces](#namespace) and [tables](#table). These map directly to
      [Apache Iceberg catalogs](https://iceberg.apache.org/concepts/catalog/).


      For information on managing catalogs with the REST API or for more
      information on what data can be associated with a catalog, see [the API
      docs](../regtests/client/python/docs/CreateCatalogRequest.md).


      ### Storage Type


      All catalogs in Polaris are associated with a _storage type_. Valid
      Storage Types are `S3`, `Azure`, and `GCS`. The `FILE` type is also
      additionally available for testing. Each of these types relates to a
      different storage provider where data within the catalog may reside.
      Depending on the storage type, various other configurations may be set for
      a catalog including credentials to be used when accessing data inside the
      catalog.


      For details on how to use Storage Types in the REST API, see [the API
      docs](../regtests/client/python/docs/StorageConfigInfo.md).


      ## Namespace


      A namespace is a logical entity that resides within a [catalog](#catalog)
      and can contain other entities such as [tables](#table) or [views](#view).
      Some other systems may refer to namespaces as _schemas_ or _databases_.


      In Polaris, namespaces can be nested. For example, `a.b.c.d.e.f.g` is a
      valid namespace. `b` is said to reside within `a`, and so on.


      For information on managing namespaces with the REST API or for more
      information on what data can be associated with a namespace, see [the API
      docs](../regtests/client/python/docs/CreateNamespaceRequest.md).



      ## Table


      Polaris tables are entities that map to [Apache Iceberg
      tables](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/nightly/configuration/).


      For information on managing tables with the REST API or for more
      information on what data can be associated with a table, see [the API
      docs](../regtests/client/python/docs/CreateTableRequest.md).


      ## View


      Polaris views are entities that map to [Apache Iceberg
      views](https://iceberg.apache.org/view-spec/).


      For information on managing views with the REST API or for more
      information on what data can be associated with a view, see [the API
      docs](../regtests/client/python/docs/CreateViewRequest.md).


      ## Principal


      Polaris principals are unique identities that can be used to represent
      users or services. Each principal may have one or more [principal
      roles](#principal-role) assigned to it for the purpose of accessing
      catalogs and the entities within them.


      For information on managing principals with the REST API or for more
      information on what data can be associated with a principal, see [the API
      docs](../regtests/client/python/docs/CreatePrincipalRequest.md).


      ## Principal Role


      Polaris principal roles are labels that may be granted to
      [principals](#principal). Each principal may have one or more principal
      roles, and the same principal role may be granted to multiple principals.
      Principal roles may be assigned based on the persona or responsibilities
      of a given principal, or on how that principal will need to access
      different entities within Polaris.


      For information on managing principal roles with the REST API or for more
      information on what data can be associated with a principal role, see [the
      API docs](../regtests/client/python/docs/CreatePrincipalRoleRequest.md).



      ## Catalog Role


      Polaris catalog roles are labels that may be granted to
      [catalogs](#catalog). Each catalog may have one or more catalog roles, and
      the same catalog role may be granted to multiple catalogs. Catalog roles
      may be assigned based on the nature of data that will reside in a catalog,
      or by the groups of users and services that might need to access that
      data. 


      Each catalog role may have multiple [privileges](#privilege) granted to
      it, and each catalog role can be granted to one or more [principal
      roles](#principal-role). This is the mechanism by which principals are
      granted access to entities inside a catalog such as namespaces and tables.


      ## Privilege


      Polaris privileges are granted to [catalog roles](#catalog-role) in order
      to grant principals with a given principal role some degree of access to
      catalogs with a given catalog role. When a privilege is granted to a
      catalog role, any principal roles granted that catalog role receive the
      privilege. In turn, any principals who are granted that principal role
      receive it. 


      A privilege can be scoped to any entity inside a catalog, including the
      catalog itself.


      For a list of supported privileges for each privilege class, see the API
      docs:

      * [Table Privileges](../regtests/client/python/docs/TablePrivilege.md)

      * [View Privileges](../regtests/client/python/docs/ViewPrivilege.md)

      * [Namespace
      Privileges](../regtests/client/python/docs/NamespacePrivilege.md)

      * [Catalog Privileges](../regtests/client/python/docs/CatalogPrivilege.md)

      This section provides information about how access control works for
      Apache Polaris (Incubating).


      Polaris uses a role-based access control (RBAC) model in which the Polaris
      administrator assigns access privileges to catalog roles

      and then grants access to resources to service principals by assigning
      catalog roles to principal roles.


      These are the key concepts to understanding access control in Polaris:


      - **Securable object**

      - **Principal role**

      - **Catalog role**

      - **Privilege**


      ## Securable object


      A securable object is an object to which access can be granted. Polaris

      has the following securable objects:


      - Catalog

      - Namespace

      - Iceberg table

      - View


      ## Principal role


      A principal role is a resource in Polaris that you can use to logically
      group Polaris service principals together and grant privileges on

      securable objects.


      Polaris supports a many-to-one relationship between service principals and
      principal roles. For example, to grant the same privileges to

      multiple service principals, you can grant a single principal role to
      those service principals. A service principal can be granted one

      principal role. When registering a service connection, the Polaris
      administrator specifies the principal role that is granted to the

      service principal.


      You don't grant privileges directly to a principal role. Instead, you
      configure object permissions at the catalog role level, and then grant

      catalog roles to a principal role.


      The following table shows examples of principal roles that you might
      configure in Polaris:


      | Principal role name | Description |

      | -----------------------| ----------- |

      | Data_engineer   | A role that is granted to multiple service principals
      for running data engineering jobs. |

      | Data_scientist | A role that is granted to multiple service principals
      for running data science or AI jobs. |


      ## Catalog role


      A catalog role belongs to a particular catalog resource in Polaris and
      specifies a set of permissions for actions on the catalog or objects

      in the catalog, such as catalog namespaces or tables. You can create one
      or more catalog roles for a catalog.


      You grant privileges to a catalog role and then grant the catalog role to
      a principal role to bestow the privileges to one or more service

      principals.


      > **Note**

      >

      > If you update the privileges bestowed to a service principal, the
      updates won't take effect for up to one hour. This means that if you

      > revoke or grant some privileges for a catalog, the updated privileges
      won't take effect on any service principal with access to that catalog

      > for up to one hour.


      Polaris also supports a many-to-many relationship between catalog roles
      and principal roles. You can grant the same catalog role to one or more

      principal roles. Likewise, a principal role can be granted to one or more
      catalog roles.


      The following table displays examples of catalog roles that you might

      configure in Polaris:


      | Example Catalog role | Description |

      | -----------------------| ----------- |

      | Catalog administrators   | A role that has been granted multiple
      privileges to emulate full access to the catalog.<br /><br />Principal
      roles that have been granted this role are permitted to create, alter,
      read, write, and drop tables in the catalog.  |

      | Catalog readers      | A role that has been granted read-only privileges
      to tables in the catalog.<br /><br />Principal roles that have been
      granted this role are allowed to read from tables in the catalog. |

      | Catalog contributor   | A role that has been granted read and write
      access privileges to all tables that belong to the catalog.<br /><br
      />Principal roles that have been granted this role are allowed to perform
      read and write operations on tables in the catalog. |


      ## RBAC model


      The following diagram illustrates the RBAC model used by Polaris. For each
      catalog, the Polaris administrator assigns access

      privileges to catalog roles and then grants service principals access to
      resources by assigning catalog roles to principal roles. Polaris

      supports a many-to-one relationship between service principals and
      principal roles.


      ![Diagram that shows the RBAC model for Apache
      Polaris.](img/rbac-model.svg "Apache Polaris RBAC model")


      ## Access control privileges


      This section describes the privileges that are available in the Polaris
      access control model. Privileges are granted to catalog roles, catalog

      roles are granted to principal roles, and principal roles are granted to
      service principals to specify the operations that service principals can

      perform on objects in Polaris.


      > **Important**

      >

      > You can only grant privileges at the catalog level. Fine-grained access
      controls are not available. For example, you can grant read 

      > privileges to all tables in a catalog but not to an individual table in
      the catalog.


      To grant the full set of privileges (drop, list, read, write, etc.) on an
      object, you can use the *full privilege* option.


      ### Table privileges

      ## RBAC example


      The following diagram illustrates how RBAC works in Polaris and

      includes the following users:


      - **Alice:** A service admin who signs up for Polaris. Alice can
          create service principals. She can also create catalogs and
          namespaces and configure access control for Polaris resources.

      - **Bob:** A data engineer who uses Snowpipe Streaming (in Snowflake)
          and Apache Spark&trade; connections to interact with Polaris.

          - Alice has created a service principal for Bob. It has been
              granted the Data_engineer principal role, which in turn has been
              granted the following catalog roles: Catalog contributor and
              Data administrator (for both the Silver and Gold zone catalogs
              in the following diagram).

          - The Catalog contributor role grants permission to create
              namespaces and tables in the Bronze zone catalog.

          - The Data administrator roles grant full administrative rights to
              the Silver zone catalog and Gold zone catalog.

      - **Mark:** A data scientist who uses Snowflake AI services to
          interact with Polaris.

          - Alice has created a service principal for Mark. It has been
              granted the Data_scientist principal role, which in turn has
              been granted the catalog role named Catalog reader.

          - The Catalog reader role grants read-only access for a catalog
              named Gold zone catalog.

      # Configuring Apache Polaris (Incubating) for Production


      The default `polaris-server.yml` configuration is intended for develoment
      and testing. When deploying Polaris in production, there are several best
      practices to keep in mind.


      ## Security


      ### Configurations


      Notable configuration used to secure a Polaris deployment are outlined
      below.


      #### oauth2


      > [!WARNING]  

      > Ensure that the `tokenBroker` setting reflects the token broker
      specified in `authenticator` below.


      * Configure [OAuth](https://oauth.net/2/) with this setting. Remove the
      `TestInlineBearerTokenPolarisAuthenticator` option and uncomment the
      `DefaultPolarisAuthenticator` authenticator option beneath it.

      * Then, configure the token broker. You can configure the token broker to
      use either
      [asymmetric](https://github.com/apache/polaris/blob/b482617bf8cc508b37dbedf3ebc81a9408160a5e/polaris-service/src/main/java/io/polaris/service/auth/JWTRSAKeyPair.java#L24)
      or
      [symmetric](https://github.com/apache/polaris/blob/b482617bf8cc508b37dbedf3ebc81a9408160a5e/polaris-service/src/main/java/io/polaris/service/auth/JWTSymmetricKeyBroker.java#L23)
      keys.


      #### authenticator.tokenBroker


      > [!WARNING]  

      > Ensure that the `tokenBroker` setting reflects the token broker
      specified in `oauth2` above.


      #### callContextResolver & realmContextResolver

      * Use these configurations to specify a service that can resolve a realm
      from bearer tokens.

      * The service(s) used here must implement the relevant interfaces (i.e.
      [CallContextResolver](https://github.com/apache/polaris/blob/8290019c10290a600e40b35ddb1e2f54bf99e120/polaris-service/src/main/java/io/polaris/service/context/CallContextResolver.java#L27)
      and
      [RealmContextResolver](https://github.com/apache/polaris/blob/7ce86f10a68a3b56aed766235c88d6027c0de038/polaris-service/src/main/java/io/polaris/service/context/RealmContextResolver.java)).


      ## Metastore Management


      > [!IMPORTANT]  

      > The default `in-memory` implementation for `metastoreManager` is meant
      for testing and not suitable for production usage. Instead, consider an
      implementation such as `eclipse-link` which allows you to store metadata
      in a remote database.


      A Metastore Manger should be configured with an implementation that
      durably persists Polaris entities. Use the configuration
      `metaStoreManager` to configure a
      [MetastoreManager](https://github.com/apache/polaris/blob/627dc602eb15a3258dcc32babf8def34cf6de0e9/polaris-core/src/main/java/io/polaris/core/persistence/PolarisMetaStoreManager.java#L47)
      implementation where Polaris entities will be persisted. 


      Be sure to secure your metastore backend since it will be storing
      credentials and catalog metadata.


      ### Configuring EclipseLink


      To use [EclipseLink](https://eclipse.dev/eclipselink/) for metastore
      management, specify the configuration `metaStoreManager.conf-file` to
      point to an [EclipseLink `persistence.xml`
      file](https://eclipse.dev/eclipselink/documentation/2.5/solutions/testingjpa002.htm).
      This file, local to the Polaris service, will contain information on what
      database to use for metastore management and how to connect to it.


      ### Bootstrapping


      Before using Polaris when using a metastore manager other than
      `in-memory`, you must **bootstrap** the metastore manager. This is a
      manual operation that must be performed **only once** in order to prepare
      the metastore manager to integrate with Polaris. When the metastore
      manager is bootstrapped, any existing Polaris entities in the metastore
      manager may be **purged**.


      To bootstrap Polaris, run:


      ```bash

      java -jar /path/to/jar/polaris-service-all.jar bootstrap
      polaris-server.yml

      ```


      Afterwards, Polaris can be launched normally:


      ```bash

      java -jar /path/to/jar/polaris-service-all.jar server polaris-server.yml

      ```


      ## Other Configurations


      When deploying Polaris in production, consider adjusting the following
      configurations:


      #### featureConfiguration.SUPPORTED_CATALOG_STORAGE_TYPES
        - By default Polaris catalogs are allowed to be located in local filesystem with the `FILE` storage type. This should be disabled for production systems.
        - Use this configuration to additionally disable any other storage types that will not be in use.

         All REST clients should first call this route to get catalog configuration properties from the server to configure the catalog and its HTTP client. Configuration from the server consists of two sets of key/value pairs.
        - defaults -  properties that should be used as default configuration;
        applied before client configuration

        - overrides - properties that should be used to override client
        configuration; applied after defaults and client configuration


        Catalog configuration is constructed by setting the defaults, then
        client- provided configuration, and finally overrides. The final
        property set is then used to configure the catalog.


        For example, a default configuration property might set the size of the
        client pool, which can be replaced with a client-specific setting. An
        override might be used to set the warehouse location, which is stored on
        the server rather than in client configuration.


        Common catalog configuration settings are documented at
        https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration/#catalog-properties

      operationId: getToken
      description: >-
        Exchange credentials for a token using the OAuth2 client credentials
        flow or token exchange.


        This endpoint is used for three purposes -

        1. To exchange client credentials (client ID and secret) for an access
        token This uses the client credentials flow.

        2. To exchange a client token and an identity token for a more specific
        access token This uses the token exchange flow.

        3. To exchange an access token for one with the same claims and a
        refreshed expiration period This uses the token exchange flow.


        For example, a catalog client may be configured with client credentials
        from the OAuth2 Authorization flow. This client would exchange its
        client ID and secret for an access token using the client credentials
        request with this endpoint (1). Subsequent requests would then use that
        access token.


        Some clients may also handle sessions that have additional user context.
        These clients would use the token exchange flow to exchange a user token
        (the "subject" token) from the session for a more specific access token
        for that user, using the catalog's access token as the "actor" token
        (2). The user ID token is the "subject" token and can be any token type
        allowed by the OAuth2 token exchange flow, including a unsecured JWT
        token with a sub claim. This request should use the catalog's bearer
        token in the "Authorization" header.


        Clients may also use the token exchange flow to refresh a token that is
        about to expire by sending a token exchange request (3). The request's
        "subject" token should be the expiring token. This request should use
        the subject token in the "Authorization" header.

      description: >-
        Create a table or start a create transaction, like atomic CTAS.


        If `stage-create` is false, the table is created immediately.


        If `stage-create` is true, the table is not created, but table metadata
        is initialized and returned. The service should prepare as needed for a
        commit to the table commit endpoint to complete the create transaction.
        The client uses the returned metadata to begin a transaction. To commit
        the transaction, the client sends all create and subsequent changes to
        the table commit route. Changes from the table create operation include
        changes like AddSchemaUpdate and SetCurrentSchemaUpdate that set the
        initial table state.

        Load a table from the catalog.


        The response contains both configuration and table metadata. The
        configuration, if non-empty is used as additional configuration for the
        table that overrides catalog configuration. For example, this
        configuration may change the FileIO implementation to be used for the
        table.


        The response also contains the table's full metadata, matching the table
        metadata JSON file.


        The catalog configuration may contain credentials that should be used
        for subsequent requests for the table. The configuration key "token" is
        used to pass an access token to be used as a bearer token for table
        requests. Otherwise, a token may be passed using a RFC 8693 token type
        as a configuration key. For example,
        "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt=<JWT-token>".

      summary: Commit updates to a table
      operationId: updateTable
      description: >-
        Commit updates to a table.


        Commits have two parts, requirements and updates. Requirements are
        assertions that will be validated before attempting to make and commit
        changes. For example, `assert-ref-snapshot-id` will check that a named
        ref's snapshot ID has a certain value.


        Updates are changes to make to table metadata. For example, after
        asserting that the current main ref is at the expected snapshot, a
        commit may add a new child snapshot and set the ref to the new snapshot
        id.


        Create table transactions that are started by createTable with
        `stage-create` set to true are committed using this route. Transactions
        should include all changes to the table, including table initialization,
        like AddSchemaUpdate and SetCurrentSchemaUpdate. The `assert-create`
        requirement is used to ensure that the table was not created
        concurrently.

          Commit updates to multiple tables in an atomic operation


          A commit for a single table consists of a table identifier with
          requirements and updates. Requirements are assertions that will be
          validated before attempting to make and commit changes. For example,
          `assert-ref-snapshot-id` will check that a named ref's snapshot ID has
          a certain value.


          Updates are changes to make to table metadata. For example, after
          asserting that the current main ref is at the expected snapshot, a
          commit may add a new child snapshot and set the ref to the new
          snapshot id.

        The response contains both configuration and view metadata. The
        configuration, if non-empty is used as additional configuration for the
        view that overrides catalog configuration.


        The response also contains the view's full metadata, matching the view
        metadata JSON file.


        The catalog configuration may contain credentials that should be used
        for subsequent requests for the view. The configuration key "token" is
        used to pass an access token to be used as a bearer token for view
        requests. Otherwise, a token may be passed using a RFC 8693 token type

    Apache_Iceberg_REST_Catalog_API_PageToken:
      description: >-
        An opaque token that allows clients to make use of pagination for list
        APIs (e.g. ListTables). Clients may initiate the first paginated request
        by sending an empty query parameter `pageToken` to the server.

        Servers that support pagination should identify the `pageToken`
        parameter and return a `next-page-token` in the response if there are
        more results available.  After the initial request, the value of
        `next-page-token` from each response must be used as the `pageToken`
        parameter value for the next request. The server must return `null`
        value for the `next-page-token` in the last response.

        Servers that support pagination must return all results in a single
        response with the value of `next-page-token` set to `null` if the query
        parameter `pageToken` is not set in the request.

        Servers that do not support pagination should ignore the `pageToken`
        parameter and return all results in a single response. The
        `next-page-token` must be omitted from the response.

        Clients must interpret either `null` or missing response value of
        `next-page-token` as the end of the listing results.

        The table metadata JSON is returned in the `metadata` field. The
        corresponding file location of table metadata should be returned in the
        `metadata-location` field, unless the metadata is not yet committed. For
        example, a create transaction may return metadata that is staged but not
        committed.

        Clients can check whether metadata has changed by comparing metadata
        locations after the table has been created.



        The `config` map returns table-specific configuration for the table's
        resources, including its HTTP client and FileIO. For example, config may
        contain a specific FileIO implementation class for the table depending
        on its underlying storage.



        The following configurations should be respected by clients:


        ## General Configurations


        - `token`: Authorization bearer token to use for table requests if
        OAuth2 security is enabled 


        ## AWS Configurations


        The following configurations should be respected when working with
        tables stored in AWS S3
         - `client.region`: region to configure client for making requests to AWS
         - `s3.access-key-id`: id for for credentials that provide access to the data in S3
         - `s3.secret-access-key`: secret for credentials that provide access to data in S3 
         - `s3.session-token`: if present, this value should be used for as the session token 
         - `s3.remote-signing-enabled`: if `true` remote signing should be performed as described in the `s3-signer-open-api.yaml` specification
