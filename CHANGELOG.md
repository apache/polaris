# Apache Polaris Changelog

This changelog is used to give users and contributors condensed information about the contents of Polaris releases. 
Entries are grouped in sections like _Highlights_ or _Upgrade notes_, the provided sections can be adjusted
as necessary. Empty sections will not end up in the release notes. Contributors are encouraged to incorporate
CHANGELOG updates into their PRs when appropriate. Reviewers should be mindful of the impact of PRs and
request adding CHANGELOG notes for breaking (!) changes and possibly other sections as appropriate.   

## [Unreleased]

### Highlights

### Upgrade notes

### Breaking changes

- Helm chart: the default value of the `authentication.tokenBroker.secret.symmetricKey.secretKey` property has changed
  from `symmetric.pem` to `symmetric.key`.

### New Features

- Added Catalog configuration for S3 and STS endpoints. This also allows using non-AWS S3 implementations.

- The `IMPLICIT` authentication type enables users to create federated catalogs without explicitly
providing authentication parameters to Polaris. When the authentication type is set to `IMPLICIT`, 
the authentication parameters are picked from the environment or configuration files. 

- The `DEFAULT_LOCATION_OBJECT_STORAGE_PREFIX_ENABLED` feature was added to support placing tables
at locations that better optimize for object storage.

### Changes

- Polaris Management API clients must be prepared to deal with new attributes in `AwsStorageConfigInfo` objects.

### Deprecations

* The property `polaris.active-roles-provider.type` is deprecated in favor of
  `polaris.authentication.active-roles-provider.type`. The old property is still supported, but will be removed in a
  future release.
