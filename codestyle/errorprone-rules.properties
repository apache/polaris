AnnotateFormatMethod=ERROR
# This method passes a pair of parameters through to String.format, but the enclosing method wasn't annotated @FormatMethod. Doing so gives compile-time rather than run-time protection against malformed format strings.

ArrayAsKeyOfSetOrMap=ERROR
# Arrays do not override equals() or hashCode, so comparisons will be done on reference equality only. If neither deduplication nor lookup are needed, consider using a List instead. Otherwise, use IdentityHashMap/Set, a Map from a library that handles object arrays, or an Iterable/List of pairs.

AssertEqualsArgumentOrderChecker=ERROR
# Arguments are swapped in assertEquals-like call

AssertThrowsMultipleStatements=ERROR
# The lambda passed to assertThrows should contain exactly one statement

AssertionFailureIgnored=ERROR
# This assertion throws an AssertionError if it fails, which will be caught by an enclosing try block.

BadImport=ERROR
# Importing nested classes/static methods/static fields with commonly-used names can make code harder to read, because it may not be clear from the context exactly which type is being referred to. Qualifying the name with that of the containing class can make the code clearer.

BadInstanceof=ERROR
# instanceof used in a way that is equivalent to a null check.

BareDotMetacharacter=ERROR
# "." is rarely useful as a regex, as it matches any character. To match a literal '.' character, instead write "\.".

BigDecimalEquals=ERROR
# BigDecimal#equals has surprising behavior: it also compares scale.

BigDecimalLiteralDouble=ERROR
# new BigDecimal(double) loses precision in this case.

BoxedPrimitiveConstructor=ERROR
# valueOf or autoboxing provides better time and space performance

ByteBufferBackingArray=ERROR
# ByteBuffer.array() shouldn't be called unless ByteBuffer.arrayOffset() is used or if the ByteBuffer was initialized using ByteBuffer.wrap() or ByteBuffer.allocate().

CanIgnoreReturnValueSuggester=OFF
# Methods that always 'return this' should be annotated with @CanIgnoreReturnValue

CatchAndPrintStackTrace=ERROR
# Logging or rethrowing exceptions should usually be preferred to catching and calling printStackTrace

ClassCanBeStatic=ERROR
# Inner class is non-static but does not reference enclosing class

ClassNewInstance=ERROR
# Class.newInstance() bypasses exception checking; prefer getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance()

DateFormatConstant=ERROR
# DateFormat is not thread-safe, and should not be used as a constant field.

DefaultCharset=ERROR
# Implicit use of the platform default charset, which can result in differing behaviour between JVM executions or incorrect behavior if the encoding of the data source doesn't match expectations.

DistinctVarargsChecker=ERROR
# Method expects distinct arguments at some/all positions

DoubleCheckedLocking=ERROR
# Double-checked locking on non-volatile fields is unsafe

EqualsGetClass=ERROR
# Prefer instanceof to getClass when implementing Object#equals.

EqualsIncompatibleType=ERROR
# An equality test between objects with incompatible types always returns false

EqualsUnsafeCast=ERROR
# The contract of #equals states that it should return false for incompatible types, while this implementation may throw ClassCastException.

EqualsUsingHashCode=ERROR
# Implementing #equals by just comparing hashCodes is fragile. Hashes collide frequently, and this will lead to false positives in #equals.

ErroneousBitwiseExpression=ERROR
# This expression evaluates to 0. If this isn't an error, consider expressing it as a literal 0.

ErroneousThreadPoolConstructorChecker=ERROR
# Thread pool size will never go beyond corePoolSize if an unbounded queue is used

EscapedEntity=ERROR
# HTML entities in @code/@literal tags will appear literally in the rendered javadoc.

FallThrough=ERROR
# Switch case may fall through

FloatCast=ERROR
# Use parentheses to make the precedence explicit

FloatingPointAssertionWithinEpsilon=ERROR
# This fuzzy equality check is using a tolerance less than the gap to the next number. You may want a less restrictive tolerance, or to assert equality.

FloatingPointLiteralPrecision=ERROR
# Floating point literal loses precision

FutureReturnValueIgnored=ERROR
# Return value of methods returning Future must be checked. Ignoring returned Futures suppresses exceptions thrown from the code that completes the Future.

GetClassOnEnum=ERROR
# Calling getClass() on an enum may return a subclass of the enum type

InconsistentHashCode=ERROR
# Including fields in hashCode which are not compared in equals violates the contract of hashCode.

IntLongMath=ERROR
# Expression of type int may overflow before being assigned to a long

JavaLangClash=ERROR
# Never reuse class names from java.lang

JdkObsolete=ERROR
# Suggests alternatives to obsolete JDK classes.

LockNotBeforeTry=ERROR
# Calls to Lock#lock should be immediately followed by a try block which releases the lock.

LongDoubleConversion=ERROR
# Conversion from long to double may lose precision; use an explicit cast to double if this was intentional

LongFloatConversion=ERROR
# Conversion from long to float may lose precision; use an explicit cast to float if this was intentional

MissingCasesInEnumSwitch=ERROR
# Switches on enum types should either handle all values, or have a default case.

MissingOverride=ERROR
# method overrides method in supertype; expected @Override

ModifiedButNotUsed=ERROR
# A collection or proto builder was created, but its values were never accessed.

MockNotUsedInProduction=ERROR
# This mock is instantiated and configured, but is never passed to production code. It should be
# either removed or used.

NonAtomicVolatileUpdate=ERROR
# This update of a volatile variable is non-atomic

NonCanonicalType=ERROR
# This type is referred to by a non-canonical name, which may be misleading.

NotJavadoc=ERROR
# Avoid using /** for comments which aren't actually Javadoc.

NullOptional=ERROR
# Passing a literal null to an Optional parameter is almost certainly a mistake. Did you mean to provide an empty Optional?

ObjectEqualsForPrimitives=ERROR
# Avoid unnecessary boxing by using plain == for primitive types.

OperatorPrecedence=ERROR
# Use grouping parenthesis to make the operator precedence explicit

OrphanedFormatString=ERROR
# String literal contains format specifiers, but is not passed to a format method

Overrides=ERROR
# Varargs doesn't agree for overridden method

PatternMatchingInstanceof=WARN
# This code can be simplified to use a pattern-matching instanceof.

StreamToIterable=ERROR
# Using stream::iterator creates a one-shot Iterable, which may cause surprising failures.

SynchronizeOnNonFinalField=ERROR
# Synchronizing on non-final fields is not safe: if the field is ever updated, different threads may end up locking on different objects.

ThreadLocalUsage=ERROR
# ThreadLocals should be stored in static fields

URLEqualsHashCode=ERROR
# Avoid hash-based containers of java.net.URL–the containers rely on equals() and hashCode(), which cause java.net.URL to make blocking internet connections.

UnnecessaryLambda=ERROR
# Returning a lambda from a helper method or saving it in a constant is unnecessary; prefer to implement the functional interface method directly and use a method reference instead.

UnusedMethod=ERROR
# Unused.

UnusedNestedClass=ERROR
# This nested class is unused, and can be removed.

UnusedTypeParameter=ERROR
# This type parameter is unused and can be removed.

UseCorrectAssertInTests=ERROR
# Java assert is used in test. For testing purposes Assert.* matchers should be used.

ConstantPatternCompile=ERROR
# Variables initialized with Pattern#compile calls on constants can be constants

ObjectsHashCodePrimitive=ERROR
# Objects.hashCode(Object o) should not be passed a primitive value

OptionalMapToOptional=ERROR
# Mapping to another Optional will yield a nested Optional. Did you mean flatMap?

PrimitiveArrayPassedToVarargsMethod=ERROR
# Passing a primitive array to a varargs method is usually wrong

RedundantOverride=ERROR
# This overriding method is redundant, and can be removed.

RedundantThrows=ERROR
# Thrown exception is a subtype of another

StringCaseLocaleUsage=ERROR
# Specify a `Locale` when calling `String#to{Lower,Upper}Case`. (Note: there are multiple suggested fixes; the third may be most appropriate if you're dealing with ASCII Strings.)

StringCharset=ERROR
# Prefer StandardCharsets over using string names for charsets

StronglyTypeByteString=WARN
# This primitive byte array is only used to construct ByteStrings. It would be clearer to strongly type the field instead.

StronglyTypeTime=ERROR
# This primitive integral type is only used to construct time types. It would be clearer to strongly type the field instead.

TestExceptionChecker=ERROR
# Using @Test(expected=…) is discouraged, since the test will pass if any statement in the test method throws the expected exception

TransientMisuse=ERROR
# Static fields are implicitly transient, so the explicit modifier is unnecessary

UrlInSee=ERROR
# URLs should not be used in @see tags; they are designed for Java elements which could be used with @link.

VariableNameSameAsType=ERROR
# variableName and type with the same name would refer to the static field instead of the class

####################################################################################################
# Experimental : SUGGESTION

FieldCanBeStatic=ERROR
# A final field initialized at compile-time with an instance of an immutable type can be static.

ForEachIterable=ERROR
# This loop can be replaced with an enhanced for loop.

MixedArrayDimensions=ERROR
# C-style array declarations should not be used

PackageLocation=ERROR
# Package names should match the directory they are declared in

TryFailRefactoring=ERROR
# Prefer assertThrows to try/fail

UnnecessaryBoxedAssignment=WARN
# This expression can be implicitly boxed.

UnnecessaryBoxedVariable=ERROR
# It is unnecessary for this variable to be boxed. Use the primitive instead.

UseEnumSwitch=ERROR
# Prefer using a switch instead of a chained if-else for enums

WildcardImport=ERROR
#  Wildcard imports, static or otherwise, should not be used
