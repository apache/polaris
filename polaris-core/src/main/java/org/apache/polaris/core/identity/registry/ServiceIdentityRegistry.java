 * A registry interface for managing and resolving service identities in Polaris.
 *
 * <p>In a multi-tenant Polaris deployment, each catalog or tenant may be associated with a distinct
 * service identity that represents the Polaris service itself when accessing external systems
 * (e.g., cloud services like AWS or GCP). This registry provides a central mechanism to manage
 * those identities and resolve them at runtime.
 *
 * <p>The registry helps abstract the configuration and retrieval of service-managed credentials
 * from the logic that uses them. It ensures a consistent and secure way to handle identity
 * resolution across different deployment models, including SaaS and self-managed environments.
