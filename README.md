# Apache Polaris (incubating)

Apache Polaris&trade; is an open-source, fully-featured catalog for Apache Iceberg&trade;. It implements Iceberg's 
[REST API](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/main/open-api/rest-catalog-open-api.yaml),
enabling seamless multi-engine interoperability across a wide range of platforms, including Apache Doris™, Apache Flink®,
Apache Spark™, StarRocks, and Trino. 

Documentation is available at https://polaris.apache.org. The REST OpenAPI specifications are available here:
[Polaris management API doc](https://editor-next.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/polaris/refs/heads/main/spec/polaris-management-service.yml)
and [Polaris Catalog API doc](https://editor-next.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/polaris/refs/heads/main/spec/generated/bundled-polaris-catalog-service.yaml).

## Polaris Overview
Click [here](https://polaris.apache.org/in-dev/unreleased/) for a quick overview of Polaris.

## Quickstart
Click [here](https://polaris.apache.org/in-dev/unreleased/getting-started/install-dependencies/) for the quickstart experience, which will help you set up a Polaris instance locally or on any supported cloud provider.

## Building and Running 

Apache Polaris is organized into the following modules:

- `polaris-core` - The main Polaris entity definitions and core business logic
- API modules (implementing the Iceberg REST API and Polaris management API):
  - `polaris-api-management-model` - The Polaris management model
  - `polaris-api-management-service` - The Polaris management service
  - `polaris-api-iceberg-service` - The Iceberg REST service
- Service modules:
  - `polaris-service-common` - The main components of the Polaris server
- Runtime modules:
  - `polaris-runtime-service` - The runtime components of the Polaris server
  - `polaris-runtime-defaults` - The runtime configuration defaults
  - `polaris-server` - The Polaris server
  - `polaris-admin` - The Polaris admin & maintenance tool
- Persistence modules:
  - `polaris-eclipselink` - The Eclipselink implementation of the MetaStoreManager interface
  - `polaris-relational-jdbc` - The JDBC implementation of BasePersistence to be used via AtomicMetaStoreManager
 
Apache Polaris is built using Gradle with Java 21+ and Docker 27+.

- `./gradlew build` - To build and run tests. Make sure Docker is running, as the integration tests depend on it.
- `./gradlew assemble` - To skip tests.
- `./gradlew check` - To run all checks, including unit tests and integration tests.
- `./gradlew run` - To run the Polaris server locally; the server is reachable at localhost:8181. This is also suitable for running regression tests, or for connecting with Spark. Set your own credentials by specifying system property `./gradlew run -Dpolaris.bootstrap.credentials=POLARIS,root,s3cr3t` where:
  - `POLARIS` is the realm
  - `root` is the CLIENT_ID
  - `secret` is the CLIENT_SECRET
  - If credentials are not set, it will use preset credentials `POLARIS,root,s3cr3t`
- `./regtests/run_spark_sql.sh` - To connect from Spark SQL. Here are some example commands to run in the Spark SQL shell:
```sql
create database db1;
show databases;
create table db1.table1 (id int, name string);
insert into db1.table1 values (1, 'a');
select * from db1.table1;
```
- `env POLARIS_HOST=localhost ./regtests/run.sh` - To run regression tests locally, see more options [here](./regtests/README.md).

## Makefile Convenience Commands

To streamline the developer experience, especially for common setup and build tasks, a root-level Makefile is available. This Makefile acts as a convenient wrapper around various Gradle commands and other tooling, simplifying interactions. While Gradle remains the primary build system, the Makefile provides concise shortcuts for frequent operations like:
  - Building Polaris components: e.g., `make build-server, make build-admin`
  - Managing development clusters: e.g., `make minikube-start-cluster, make minikube-cleanup`
  - Automating Helm tasks: e.g., `make helm-doc-generate, make helm-unittest`
  - Handling dependencies: e.g., `make install-dependencies-brew`

To see available commands:
```bash
make help
```

For example, to build the Polaris server and its container image, you can simply run:
```bash
make build-server
```

### More build and run options

#### Running in Docker

- To build the image locally:
  ```bash
  ./gradlew \
    :polaris-server:assemble \
    :polaris-server:quarkusAppPartsBuild --rerun \
    -Dquarkus.container-image.build=true
  ```
- `docker run -p 8181:8181 -p 8182:8182 apache/polaris:latest` - To run the image.

The Polaris codebase contains some docker compose examples to quickly get started with Polaris,
using different configurations. Check the `./getting-started` directory for more information.

#### Running in Kubernetes

- See [README in `helm/polaris`](helm/polaris/README.md) for more information.

#### Configuring Polaris

Polaris Servers can be configured using a variety of ways.
Please see the [Configuration Guide](site/content/in-dev/unreleased/configuration.md)
for more information.

Default configuration values can be found in `runtime/defaults/src/main/resources/application.properties`.

#### Building docs

- Docs are generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the [Docsy](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/) theme.
- To view the site locally, run
  ```bash
  site/bin/run-hugo-in-docker.sh
  ```
- See [README in `site/`](site/README.md) for more information.

## ASF Incubator disclaimer

Apache Polaris&trade; is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
