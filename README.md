# Polaris Catalog

<a href="https://www.snowflake.com/blog/polaris-catalog-open-source/" target="_blank">Polaris Catalog</a> is an open source catalog for Apache Iceberg :tm:. Polaris Catalog implements Iceberg’s open <a href="https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/main/open-api/rest-catalog-open-api.yaml" target="_blank">REST API</a> for multi-engine interoperability with Apache Doris :tm:, Apache Flink® , Apache Spark :tm:, StarRocks, and Trino.

## API Docs

API docs are hosted via GitHub Pages at https://polaris.io. All updates to the main branch update the hosted docs.

The Polaris management API docs are found [here](https://polaris.io/index.html#tag/polaris-management-service_other).

The Apache Iceberg REST API docs are found [here](https://polaris.io/index.html#tag/Configuration-API).

Docs are generated using [Redocly](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/installation). They can be regenerated by running the following commands from the project root directory:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 -v ${PWD}:/spec docker.io/redocly/cli join spec/docs.yaml spec/polaris-management-service.yml spec/rest-catalog-open-api.yaml -o spec/index.yaml --prefix-components-with-info-prop title
docker run -p 8080:80 -v ${PWD}:/spec docker.io/redocly/cli build-docs spec/index.yaml --output=docs/index.html --config=spec/redocly.yaml
```

# Setup

## Requirements

- Java JDK >= 21, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md#java-version-requirements).
- Gradle - This is included in the project and can be run using `./gradlew` in the project root.
- Docker (Suggested Version: 27+) - If you want to run the project in a containerized environment or run integration tests.

## Getting Started

Polaris is a multi-module project with three modules:

- `polaris-core` - The main Polaris entity definitions and core business logic.
- `polaris-server` - The Polaris REST API server.
- `polaris-eclipselink` - The Eclipselink implementation of the MetaStoreManager interface.

Build the binary (first time may require installing new JDK version). This build will run IntegrationTests by default.
Make sure docker is running, as the integration tests require a running docker daemon.

```
./gradlew build
```

To skip tests:

```
./gradlew assemble
```

Run the Polaris server locally on [http://localhost:8181](http://localhost:8181):

```
./gradlew runApp
```

The server will start using the in-memory mode, and it will print its auto-generated credentials to STDOUT in a message like the following:

```text
realm: default-realm root principal credentials: <id>:<secret>
```

These credentials can be used as "Client ID" and "Client Secret" in OAuth2 requests (e.g. the `curl` command below).

While the Polaris server is running, run regression tests, or end-to-end tests in another terminal:

```
./regtests/run.sh
```

## Docker Instructions

Build the image:

```
docker build -t localhost:5001/polaris:latest .
```

Run it in a standalone mode. This runs a single container that binds the container's port `8181` to localhost `8181`:

```
docker run -p 8181:8181 localhost:5001/polaris:latest
```

# Running the Tests

## Unit and Integration Tests

Unit and integration tests are run using gradle. To run all tests, use the following command:

```bash
./gradlew test
```

## Regression Tests

Regression tests, or functional tests, are stored in the `regtests` directory. They can be executed in a docker
environment by using the `docker-compose.yml` file in the project root.

```bash
docker compose up --build --exit-code-from regtest
```

They can also be executed outside of docker by following the setup instructions in the [README](regtests/README.md).

## Kubernetes Instructions

You can run Polaris as a mini-deployment locally. This will create two pods that bind themselves to port `8181`:

```
./setup.sh
```

You can check the pod and deployment status like so:

```
kubectl get pods
kubectl get deployment
```

If things aren't working as expected you can troubleshoot like so:

```
kubectl describe deployment polaris-deployment
```

## Creating a Catalog Manually

Before connecting with Spark, you'll need to create a catalog. To create a catalog, generate a token for the root principal:

```bash
curl -i -X POST \
  http://localhost:8181/api/catalog/v1/oauth/tokens \
  -d 'grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=<principalClientId>&client_secret=<mainSecret>&scope=PRINCIPAL_ROLE:ALL'
```

The response output will contain an access token:

```json
{
  "access_token": "ver:1-hint:1036-ETMsDgAAAY/GPANareallyverylongstringthatissecret",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600
}
```

Set the contents of the `access_token` field as the `PRINCIPAL_TOKEN` variable. Then use `curl` to invoke the `createCatalog` api:

```bash
$ export PRINCIPAL_TOKEN=ver:1-hint:1036-ETMsDgAAAY/GPANareallyverylongstringthatissecret

$ curl -i -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $PRINCIPAL_TOKEN" -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  http://${POLARIS_HOST:-localhost}:8181/api/management/v1/catalogs \
  -d '{"name": "polaris", "id": 100, "type": "INTERNAL", "readOnly": false, "storageConfigInfo": {"storageType": "FILE"}, "properties": {"default-base-location": "file:///tmp/polaris"}}'
```

This creates a catalog called `polaris`. From here, you can use Spark to create namespaces, tables, etc.

You must run the following as the first query in your spark-sql shell to actually use Polaris:

```
use polaris;
```
