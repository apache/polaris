# Apache Polaris (incubating)

Apache Polaris&trade; is an open-source, fully-featured catalog for Apache Iceberg&trade;. It implements Iceberg's 
[REST API](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/main/open-api/rest-catalog-open-api.yaml),
enabling seamless multi-engine interoperability across a wide range of platforms, including Apache Doris™, Apache Flink®,
Apache Spark™, StarRocks, and Trino.

Documentation is available at https://polaris.apache.org, including
[Polaris management API doc](https://polaris.apache.org/index.html#tag/polaris-management-service_other)
and [Apache Iceberg REST API doc](https://polaris.apache.org/index.html#tag/Configuration-API).

## Building and Running 

Apache Polaris is organized into the following modules:

- `polaris-core` - The main Polaris entity definitions and core business logic
- API modules (implementing the Iceberg REST API and Polaris management API):
  - `polaris-api-management-model` - The Polaris management model
  - `polaris-api-management-service` - The Polaris management service
  - `polaris-api-iceberg-service` - The Iceberg REST service
- Service modules:
  - `polaris-service-common` - The main components of the Polaris server
- Quarkus runtime modules:
  - `polaris-quarkus-service` - The Quarkus-specific components of the Polaris server
  - `polaris-quarkus-defaults` - The Quarkus-specific configuration defaults
  - `polaris-quarkus-server` - The Polaris server runtime
  - `polaris-quarkus-admin-tool` - The Polaris admin & maintenance tool
- Persistence modules:
  - `polaris-jpa-model` - The JPA entity definitions
  - `polaris-eclipselink` - The Eclipselink implementation of the MetaStoreManager interface
 
Apache Polaris is built using Gradle with Java 21+ and Docker 27+.

- `./gradlew build` - To build and run tests. Make sure Docker is running, as the integration tests depend on it.
- `./gradlew assemble` - To skip tests.
- `./gradlew test` - To run unit tests and integration tests.
- `./gradlew run` - To run the Polaris server locally; the server is reachable at 
  localhost:8181. This is also suitable for running regression tests, or for connecting with Spark. 
- `./regtests/run_spark_sql.sh` - To connect from Spark SQL. Here are some example commands to run in the Spark SQL shell:
```sql
create database db1;
show databases;
create table db1.table1 (id int, name string);
insert into db1.table1 values (1, 'a');
select * from db1.table1;
```
- `env POLARIS_HOST=localhost ./regtests/run.sh` - To run regression tests locally, see more options [here](./regtests/README.md).
### More build and run options

#### Running in Docker

- `./gradlew clean :polaris-quarkus-server:assemble -Dquarkus.container-image.build=true --no-build-cache` - To 
  build the image locally.
- `docker run -p 8181:8181 -p 8182:8182 apache/polaris:latest` - To run the image.

The Polaris codebase contains some docker compose examples to quickly get started with Polaris,
using different configurations. Check the `./getting-started` directory for more information.

#### Running in Kubernetes

- `./run.sh` - To run Polaris as a mini-deployment locally. This will create a Kind cluster, 
  then deploy one pod and one service. The service is available on ports `8181` and `8182`.
- `kubectl port-forward svc/polaris-service -n polaris 8181:8181 8182:8182` - To create secure 
  connections between a local machine and a pod within the cluster for both service and 
  health/metrics endpoints:
  - http://localhost:8182/q/metrics
  - http://localhost:8182/q/health
- `kubectl get pods -n polaris` - To check the status of the pods.
- `kubectl get deployment -n polaris` - To check the status of the deployment.
- `kubectl describe deployment polaris-deployment -n polaris` - To troubleshoot if things aren't working as expected.

#### Configuring Polaris

Polaris Servers can be configured using a variety of ways.
Please see the [Configuration Guide](site/content/in-dev/unreleased/configuration.md)
for more information.

Default configuration values can be found in `quarkus/defaults/src/main/resources/application.properties`.

#### Building docs

- Docs are generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the [Docsy](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/) theme.
- To view the site locally, run
  ```bash
  site/bin/run-hugo-in-docker.sh
  ```
- See [README in `site/`](site/README.md) for more information.

## ASF Incubator disclaimer

Apache Polaris&trade; is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
