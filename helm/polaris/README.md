A Helm chart for Apache Polaris (incubating).

**Homepage:** <https://polaris.apache.org/>

## Source Code

* <https://github.com/apache/polaris>

## Installation

### Running locally with a Minikube cluster

The below instructions assume Minikube and Helm are installed.

Start the Minikube cluster, build and load image into the Minikube cluster:

```bash
minikube start
eval $(minikube docker-env)

./gradlew \
  :polaris-server:assemble \
  :polaris-server:quarkusAppPartsBuild --rerun \
  :polaris-admin:assemble \
  :polaris-admin:quarkusAppPartsBuild --rerun \
  -Dquarkus.container-image.build=true
```

### Installing the chart locally

The below instructions assume a local Kubernetes cluster is running and Helm is installed.

#### Common setup

Create the target namespace:
```bash
kubectl create namespace polaris
```

Create all the required resources in the `polaris` namespace. This usually includes a Postgres
database, Kubernetes secrets, and service accounts. The Polaris chart does not create
these resources automatically, as they are not required for all Polaris deployments. The chart will
fail if these resources are not created beforehand. You can find some examples in the
`helm/polaris/ci/fixtures` directory, but beware that these are primarily intended for tests.

Below are two sample deployment models for installing the chart: one with a non-persistent backend and another with a persistent backend.

> [!WARNING]
> The examples below use values files located in the `helm/polaris/ci` directory.
> **These files are intended for testing purposes primarily, and may not be suitable for production use**.
> For production deployments, create your own values files based on the provided examples.

#### Non-persistent backend

Install the chart with a non-persistent backend. From Polaris repo root:
```bash
helm upgrade --install --namespace polaris \
  polaris helm/polaris
```

#### Persistent backend

> [!WARNING]
> The Postgres deployment set up in the fixtures directory is intended for testing purposes only and is not suitable for production use. For production deployments, use a managed Postgres service or a properly configured and secured Postgres instance.

Install the chart with a persistent backend. From Polaris repo root:
```bash
helm upgrade --install --namespace polaris \
  --values helm/polaris/ci/persistence-values.yaml \
  polaris helm/polaris
kubectl wait --namespace polaris --for=condition=ready pod --selector=app.kubernetes.io/name=polaris --timeout=120s
```

To access Polaris and Postgres locally, set up port forwarding for both services (This is needed for bootstrap processes):
```bash
kubectl port-forward -n polaris $(kubectl get pod -n polaris -l app.kubernetes.io/name=polaris -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') 8181:8181

kubectl port-forward -n polaris $(kubectl get pod -n polaris -l app.kubernetes.io/name=postgres -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') 5432:5432
```

Run the catalog bootstrap using the Polaris admin tool. This step initializes the catalog with the required configuration:
```bash
container_envs=$(kubectl exec -it -n polaris $(kubectl get pod -n polaris -l app.kubernetes.io/name=polaris -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') -- env)
export QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=$(echo "$container_envs" | grep quarkus.datasource.username | awk -F '=' '{print $2}' | tr -d '\n\r')
export QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=$(echo "$container_envs" | grep quarkus.datasource.password | awk -F '=' '{print $2}' | tr -d '\n\r')
export QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_JDBC_URL=$(echo "$container_envs" | grep quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url | sed 's/postgres/localhost/2' | awk -F '=' '{print $2}' | tr -d '\n\r')

java -jar runtime/admin/build/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar bootstrap -c POLARIS,root,pass -r POLARIS
```

### Uninstalling

```bash
helm uninstall --namespace polaris polaris

kubectl delete --namespace polaris -f helm/polaris/ci/fixtures/

kubectl delete namespace polaris
```

## Development & Testing

This section is intended for developers who want to run the Polaris Helm chart tests.

### Prerequisites

The following tools are required to run the tests:

* [Helm Unit Test](https://github.com/helm-unittest/helm-unittest)
* [Chart Testing](https://github.com/helm/chart-testing)

Quick installation instructions for these tools:
```bash
helm plugin install https://github.com/helm-unittest/helm-unittest.git
brew install chart-testing
```

The integration tests also require some fixtures to be deployed. The `ci/fixtures` directory
contains the required resources. To deploy them, run the following command:
```bash
kubectl apply --namespace polaris -f helm/polaris/ci/fixtures/
kubectl wait --namespace polaris --for=condition=ready pod --selector=app.kubernetes.io/name=postgres --timeout=120s
```

The `helm/polaris/ci` contains a number of values files that will be used to install the chart with
different configurations.

### Running the unit tests

Helm unit tests do not require a Kubernetes cluster. To run the unit tests, execute Helm Unit from
the Polaris repo root:
```bash
helm unittest helm/polaris
```

You can also lint the chart using the Chart Testing tool, with the following command:

```bash
ct lint --charts helm/polaris
```

### Running the integration tests

Integration tests require a Kubernetes cluster. See installation instructions above for setting up
a local cluster.

Integration tests are run with the Chart Testing tool:
```bash
ct install --namespace polaris --charts ./helm/polaris
```

This can be used to transform the role names in the identity into role names as expected by Polaris. The default ActiveRolesProvider expects the security identity to expose role names in the format `POLARIS_ROLE:<role name>`. |
| oidc.principalRolesMapper.rolesClaimPath | string | `nil` | The path to the claim that contains the principal roles. Nested paths can be expressed using "/" as a separator, e.g. "polaris/principal_roles" would look for the "principal_roles" field inside the "polaris" object in the token claims. If not set, Quarkus looks for roles in standard locations. See https://quarkus.io/guides/security-oidc-bearer-token-authentication#token-claims-and-security-identity-roles. |

| replicaCount | int | `1` | The number of replicas to deploy (horizontal scaling). Beware that replicas are stateless; don't set this number > 1 when using in-memory meta store manager. |
| resources | object | `{}` | Configures the resources requests and limits for polaris pods. We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'. |
| revisionHistoryLimit | string | `nil` | The number of old ReplicaSets to retain to allow rollback (if not set, the default Kubernetes value is set to 10). |
| service | object | `{"annotations":{},"clusterIP":null,"externalTrafficPolicy":null,"internalTrafficPolicy":null,"ports":[{"name":"polaris-http","nodePort":null,"port":8181,"protocol":null,"targetPort":null}],"sessionAffinity":null,"trafficDistribution":null,"type":"ClusterIP"}` | Polaris main service settings. |
| service.annotations | object | `{}` | Annotations to add to the service. |
| service.clusterIP | string | `nil` | You can specify your own cluster IP address If you define a Service that has the .spec.clusterIP set to "None" then Kubernetes does not assign an IP address. Instead, DNS records for the service will return the IP addresses of each pod targeted by the server. This is called a headless service. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#headless-services |
| service.externalTrafficPolicy | string | `nil` | Controls how traffic from external sources is routed. Valid values are Cluster and Local. The default value is Cluster. Set the field to Cluster to route traffic to all ready endpoints. Set the field to Local to only route to ready node-local endpoints. If the traffic policy is Local and there are no node-local endpoints, traffic is dropped by kube-proxy. |
| service.internalTrafficPolicy | string | `nil` | Controls how traffic from internal sources is routed. Valid values are Cluster and Local. The default value is Cluster. Set the field to Cluster to route traffic to all ready endpoints. Set the field to Local to only route to ready node-local endpoints. If the traffic policy is Local and there are no node-local endpoints, traffic is dropped by kube-proxy. |
| service.ports | list | `[{"name":"polaris-http","nodePort":null,"port":8181,"protocol":null,"targetPort":null}]` | The ports the service will listen on. At least one port is required; the first port implicitly becomes the HTTP port that the application will use for serving API requests. By default, it's 8181. Note: port names must be unique and no more than 15 characters long. |
| service.ports[0] | object | `{"name":"polaris-http","nodePort":null,"port":8181,"protocol":null,"targetPort":null}` | The name of the port. Required. |
| service.ports[0].nodePort | string | `nil` | The port on each node on which this service is exposed when type is NodePort or LoadBalancer. Usually assigned by the system. If not specified, a port will be allocated if this Service requires one. If this field is specified when creating a Service which does not need it, creation will fail. |
| service.ports[0].port | int | `8181` | The port the service listens on. By default, the HTTP port is 8181. |
| service.ports[0].protocol | string | `nil` | The IP protocol for this port. Supports "TCP", "UDP", and "SCTP". Default is TCP. |
| service.ports[0].targetPort | string | `nil` | Number or name of the port to access on the pods targeted by the service. If this is a string, it will be looked up as a named port in the target Pod's container ports. If this is not specified, the value of the 'port' field is used. |
| service.sessionAffinity | string | `nil` | The session affinity for the service. Valid values are: None, ClientIP. The default value is None. ClientIP enables sticky sessions based on the client's IP address. This is generally beneficial to Polaris deployments, but some testing may be required in order to make sure that the load is distributed evenly among the pods. Also, this setting affects only internal clients, not external ones. If Ingress is enabled, it is recommended to set sessionAffinity to None. |
| service.trafficDistribution | string | `nil` | The traffic distribution field provides another way to influence traffic routing within a Kubernetes Service. While traffic policies focus on strict semantic guarantees, traffic distribution allows you to express preferences such as routing to topologically closer endpoints. The only valid value is: PreferClose. The default value is implementation-specific. |
| service.type | string | `"ClusterIP"` | The type of service to create. Valid values are: ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. The default value is ClusterIP. |
| serviceAccount.annotations | object | `{}` | Annotations to add to the service account. |
| serviceAccount.create | bool | `true` | Specifies whether a service account should be created. |
| serviceAccount.name | string | `""` | The name of the service account to use. If not set and create is true, a name is generated using the fullname template. |
| serviceMonitor.enabled | bool | `true` | Specifies whether a ServiceMonitor for Prometheus operator should be created. |
| serviceMonitor.interval | string | `""` | The scrape interval; leave empty to let Prometheus decide. Must be a valid duration, e.g. 1d, 1h30m, 5m, 10s. |
| serviceMonitor.labels | object | `{}` | Labels for the created ServiceMonitor so that Prometheus operator can properly pick it up. |
| serviceMonitor.metricRelabelings | list | `[]` | Relabeling rules to apply to metrics. Ref https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#relabel_config. |
| storage | object | `{"secret":{"awsAccessKeyId":null,"awsSecretAccessKey":null,"gcpToken":null,"gcpTokenLifespan":null,"name":null}}` | Storage credentials for the server. If the following properties are unset, default credentials will be used, in which case the pod must have the necessary permissions to access the storage. |
| storage.secret | object | `{"awsAccessKeyId":null,"awsSecretAccessKey":null,"gcpToken":null,"gcpTokenLifespan":null,"name":null}` | The secret to pull storage credentials from. |
| storage.secret.awsAccessKeyId | string | `nil` | The key in the secret to pull the AWS access key ID from. Only required when using AWS. |
| storage.secret.awsSecretAccessKey | string | `nil` | The key in the secret to pull the AWS secret access key from. Only required when using AWS. |
| storage.secret.gcpToken | string | `nil` | The key in the secret to pull the GCP token from. Only required when using GCP. |

| tasks | object | `{"maxConcurrentTasks":null,"maxQueuedTasks":null}` | Polaris asynchronous task executor configuration. |
| tasks.maxConcurrentTasks | string | `nil` | The maximum number of concurrent tasks that can be executed at the same time. The default is the number of available cores. |
| tasks.maxQueuedTasks | string | `nil` | The maximum number of tasks that can be queued up for execution. The default is Integer.MAX_VALUE. |
| tolerations | list | `[]` | A list of tolerations to apply to polaris pods. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/. |
| tracing.attributes | object | `{}` | Resource attributes to identify the polaris service among other tracing sources. See https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/resource/semantic_conventions/#service. If left empty, traces will be attached to a service named "Apache Polaris"; to change this, provide a service.name attribute here. |
| tracing.enabled | bool | `false` | Specifies whether tracing for the polaris server should be enabled. |
| tracing.endpoint | string | `"http://otlp-collector:4317"` | The collector endpoint URL to connect to (required). The endpoint URL must have either the http:// or the https:// scheme. The collector must talk the OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP) and the port must be its gRPC port (by default 4317). See https://quarkus.io/guides/opentelemetry for more information. |
| tracing.sample | string | `"1.0d"` | Which requests should be sampled. Valid values are: "all", "none", or a ratio between 0.0 and "1.0d" (inclusive). E.g. "0.5d" means that 50% of the requests will be sampled. Note: avoid entering numbers here, always prefer a string representation of the ratio. |
