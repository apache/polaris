# Polaris Helm chart

![Version: 0.1.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.1.0-informational?style=flat-square) ![Type: application](https://img.shields.io/badge/Type-application-informational?style=flat-square)

A Helm chart for Polaris.

**Homepage:** <https://polaris.apache.org/>

## Maintainers
* [MonkeyCanCode](https://github.com/MonkeyCanCode)
* [adutra](https://github.com/adutra)

## Source Code

* <https://github.com/apache/polaris>

## Installation

### Optional

When using a custom `persistence.xml`, a Kubernetes Secret must be created for `.persistenceConfigSecret`. Below is a sample command:
```bash
kubectl create secret generic polaris-secret -n polaris --from-file=persistence.xml
```

### From local directory (for development purposes)

From Polaris repo root:

```bash
$ helm install polaris helm/polaris --namespace polaris --create-namespace
```

### Uninstalling the chart

```bash
$ helm uninstall --namespace polaris polaris
```

| livenessProbe.timeoutSeconds | int | `10` | Number of seconds after which the probe times out. Minimum value is 1. |
| nodeSelector | object | `{}` | Node labels which must match for the polaris pod to be scheduled on that node. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector. |
| persistenceConfigSecret | string | `nil` | The secret name to pull persistence.xml from (ensure the key name is 'persistence.xml') |
| podAnnotations | object | `{}` | Annotations to apply to polaris pods. |
| podLabels | object | `{}` | Additional Labels to apply to polaris pods. |
| podSecurityContext | object | `{}` | Security context for the polaris pod. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/. |
| polarisServerConfig | object | `{"authenticator":{"class":"org.apache.polaris.service.auth.TestInlineBearerTokenPolarisAuthenticator"},"callContextResolver":{"type":"default"},"cors":{"allowed-credentials":true,"allowed-headers":["*"],"allowed-methods":["PATCH","POST","DELETE","GET","PUT"],"allowed-origins":["http://localhost:8080"],"allowed-timing-origins":["http://localhost:8080"],"exposed-headers":["*"],"preflight-max-age":600},"defaultRealms":["default-realm"],"featureConfiguration":{"ENFORCE_PRINCIPAL_CREDENTIAL_ROTATION_REQUIRED_CHECKING":false,"SUPPORTED_CATALOG_STORAGE_TYPES":["S3","GCS","AZURE","FILE"]},"io":{"factoryType":"default"},"logging":{"appenders":[{"logFormat":"%-5p [%d{ISO8601} - %-6r] [%t] [%X{aid}%X{sid}%X{tid}%X{wid}%X{oid}%X{srv}%X{job}%X{rid}] %c{30}: %m %kvp%n%ex","threshold":"ALL","type":"console"}],"level":"INFO","loggers":{"org.apache.iceberg.rest":"DEBUG","org.apache.polaris":"DEBUG"}},"maxRequestBodyBytes":-1,"metaStoreManager":{"type":"in-memory"},"oauth2":{"type":"test"},"rateLimiter":{"type":"no-op"},"realmContextResolver":{"type":"default"},"server":{"adminConnectors":[{"port":8182,"type":"http"}],"applicationConnectors":[{"port":8181,"type":"http"}],"maxThreads":200,"minThreads":10,"requestLog":{"appenders":[{"type":"console"}]}}}` | Configures for polaris-server.yml |

| resources | object | `{}` | Configures the resources requests and limits for polaris pods. We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'. |
| revisionHistoryLimit | string | `nil` | The number of old ReplicaSets to retain to allow rollback (if not set, the default Kubernetes value is set to 10). |
| securityContext | object | `{}` | Security context for the polaris container. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/. |
| service.annotations | object | `{}` | Annotations to add to the service. |
| service.ports | object | `{"polaris-metrics":8182,"polaris-service":8181}` | The ports the service will listen on. Two ports are required: one for the Polaris service and one for the metrics API. Note: port names must be unique and no more than 15 characters long. |
| service.sessionAffinity | string | `"None"` | The session affinity for the service. Valid values are: None, ClientIP. ClientIP enables sticky sessions based on the client's IP address. This is generally beneficial to Polaris deployments, but some testing may be required in order to make sure that the load is distributed evenly among the pods. Also, this setting affects only internal clients, not external ones. If Ingress is enabled, it is recommended to set sessionAffinity to None. |
| service.type | string | `"ClusterIP"` | The type of service to create. |
| serviceAccount.annotations | object | `{}` | Annotations to add to the service account. |
| serviceAccount.create | bool | `true` | Specifies whether a service account should be created. |
| serviceAccount.name | string | `""` | The name of the service account to use. If not set and create is true, a name is generated using the fullname template. |
| tolerations | list | `[]` | A list of tolerations to apply to polaris pods. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/. |
| toolsImage.pullPolicy | string | `"IfNotPresent"` | The image pull policy. |
| toolsImage.repository | string | `"registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/openjdk-21"` | The image repository to pull from (must have jar binary included). |
| toolsImage.tag | string | `"latest"` | The image tag. |
