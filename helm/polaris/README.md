# Polaris Helm chart

![Version: 0.1.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.1.0-informational?style=flat-square) ![Type: application](https://img.shields.io/badge/Type-application-informational?style=flat-square) ![AppVersion: 1.0.0-incubating-SNAPSHOT](https://img.shields.io/badge/AppVersion-1.0.0--incubating--SNAPSHOT-informational?style=flat-square)

A Helm chart for Apache Polaris (incubating).

## Source Code

* <https://github.com/apache/polaris>

## Installation

### Optional

When using a custom `persistence.xml`, a Kubernetes Secret must be created for it. Below is a sample command:
```bash
kubectl create secret generic polaris-secret -n polaris --from-file=persistence.xml
```

### Running the unit tests

Helm unit tests do not require a Kubernetes cluster. To run the unit tests from the Polaris repo
root:

```bash
helm unittest helm/polaris
```

### Running locally with a Kind cluster

The below instructions assume Kind and Helm are installed.

Simply run the `run.sh` script from the Polaris repo root, making sure to specify the
`--eclipse-link-deps` option:

```bash
./run.sh --eclipse-link-deps=org.postgresql:postgresql:42.7.4
```

This script will create a Kind cluster, deploy a local Docker registry, build the Polaris Docker
images with support for Postgres and load them into the Kind cluster. (It will also create an
example Deployment and Service with in-memory storage.)

### Running locally with a Minikube cluster

The below instructions assume a Minikube cluster is already running and Helm is installed.

If necessary, build and load the Docker images with support for Postgres into Minikube:

```bash
eval $(minikube -p minikube docker-env)

./gradlew clean :polaris-quarkus-server:assemble :polaris-quarkus-admin:assemble \
    -Dquarkus.container-image.build=true \
    -PeclipseLinkDeps=org.postgresql:postgresql:42.7.4 \
    --no-build-cache
```

### Installing the chart locally

The below instructions assume a local Kubernetes cluster is running and Helm is installed.

Create and populate the target namespace:

```bash
kubectl create namespace polaris
kubectl apply --namespace polaris -f helm/polaris/ci/fixtures/
```

Finally, install the chart. From Polaris repo root:

```bash
helm upgrade --install --namespace polaris \
  --debug --values helm/polaris/ci/simple-values.yaml \
   polaris helm/polaris
```

The `helm/polaris/ci` contains a number of values files that can be used to install the chart with
different configurations.

You can also run `ct` (chart-testing):

```bash
ct lint --charts helm/polaris
ct install --namespace polaris --debug --charts ./helm/polaris
```

### Uninstalling the chart

```bash
helm uninstall --namespace polaris polaris
```

| resources | object | `{}` | Configures the resources requests and limits for polaris pods. We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'. |
| revisionHistoryLimit | string | `nil` | The number of old ReplicaSets to retain to allow rollback (if not set, the default Kubernetes value is set to 10). |
| service | object | `{"annotations":{},"clusterIP":null,"externalTrafficPolicy":null,"internalTrafficPolicy":null,"ports":[{"name":"polaris-http","nodePort":null,"port":8181,"protocol":null,"targetPort":null}],"sessionAffinity":null,"trafficDistribution":null,"type":"ClusterIP"}` | Polaris main service settings. |
| service.annotations | object | `{}` | Annotations to add to the service. |
| service.clusterIP | string | `nil` | You can specify your own cluster IP address If you define a Service that has the .spec.clusterIP set to "None" then Kubernetes does not assign an IP address. Instead, DNS records for the service will return the IP addresses of each pod targeted by the server. This is called a headless service. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#headless-services |
| service.externalTrafficPolicy | string | `nil` | Controls how traffic from external sources is routed. Valid values are Cluster and Local. The default value is Cluster. Set the field to Cluster to route traffic to all ready endpoints. Set the field to Local to only route to ready node-local endpoints. If the traffic policy is Local and there are no node-local endpoints, traffic is dropped by kube-proxy. |
| service.internalTrafficPolicy | string | `nil` | Controls how traffic from internal sources is routed. Valid values are Cluster and Local. The default value is Cluster. Set the field to Cluster to route traffic to all ready endpoints. Set the field to Local to only route to ready node-local endpoints. If the traffic policy is Local and there are no node-local endpoints, traffic is dropped by kube-proxy. |
| service.ports | list | `[{"name":"polaris-http","nodePort":null,"port":8181,"protocol":null,"targetPort":null}]` | The ports the service will listen on. At least one port is required; the first port implicitly becomes the HTTP port that the application will use for serving API requests. By default, it's 8181. Note: port names must be unique and no more than 15 characters long. |
| service.ports[0] | object | `{"name":"polaris-http","nodePort":null,"port":8181,"protocol":null,"targetPort":null}` | The name of the port. Required. |
| service.ports[0].nodePort | string | `nil` | The port on each node on which this service is exposed when type is NodePort or LoadBalancer. Usually assigned by the system. If not specified, a port will be allocated if this Service requires one. If this field is specified when creating a Service which does not need it, creation will fail. |
| service.ports[0].port | int | `8181` | The port the service listens on. By default, the HTTP port is 8181. |
| service.ports[0].protocol | string | `nil` | The IP protocol for this port. Supports "TCP", "UDP", and "SCTP". Default is TCP. |
| service.ports[0].targetPort | string | `nil` | Number or name of the port to access on the pods targeted by the service. If this is a string, it will be looked up as a named port in the target Pod's container ports. If this is not specified, the value of the 'port' field is used. |
| service.sessionAffinity | string | `nil` | The session affinity for the service. Valid values are: None, ClientIP. The default value is None. ClientIP enables sticky sessions based on the client's IP address. This is generally beneficial to Polaris deployments, but some testing may be required in order to make sure that the load is distributed evenly among the pods. Also, this setting affects only internal clients, not external ones. If Ingress is enabled, it is recommended to set sessionAffinity to None. |
| service.trafficDistribution | string | `nil` | The traffic distribution field provides another way to influence traffic routing within a Kubernetes Service. While traffic policies focus on strict semantic guarantees, traffic distribution allows you to express preferences such as routing to topologically closer endpoints. The only valid value is: PreferClose. The default value is implementation-specific. |

| serviceMonitor.metricRelabelings | list | `[]` | Relabeling rules to apply to metrics. Ref https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#relabel_config. |
| storage | object | `{"secret":{"awsAccessKeyId":null,"awsSecretAccessKey":null,"gcpToken":null,"gcpTokenLifespan":null,"name":null}}` | Storage credentials for the server. If the following properties are unset, default credentials will be used, in which case the pod must have the necessary permissions to access the storage. |
| storage.secret | object | `{"awsAccessKeyId":null,"awsSecretAccessKey":null,"gcpToken":null,"gcpTokenLifespan":null,"name":null}` | The secret to pull storage credentials from. |
| storage.secret.awsAccessKeyId | string | `nil` | The key in the secret to pull the AWS access key ID from. Only required when using AWS. |
| storage.secret.awsSecretAccessKey | string | `nil` | The key in the secret to pull the AWS secret access key from. Only required when using AWS. |
| storage.secret.gcpToken | string | `nil` | The key in the secret to pull the GCP token from. Only required when using GCP. |
| storage.secret.gcpTokenLifespan | string | `nil` | The key in the secret to pull the GCP token expiration time from. Only required when using GCP. Must be a valid ISO 8601 duration. The default is PT1H (1 hour). |
| storage.secret.name | string | `nil` | The name of the secret to pull storage credentials from. |
| tasks | object | `{"maxConcurrentTasks":null,"maxQueuedTasks":null}` | Polaris asynchronous task executor configuration. |
| tasks.maxConcurrentTasks | string | `nil` | The maximum number of concurrent tasks that can be executed at the same time. The default is the number of available cores. |
| tasks.maxQueuedTasks | string | `nil` | The maximum number of tasks that can be queued up for execution. The default is Integer.MAX_VALUE. |
| tolerations | list | `[]` | A list of tolerations to apply to polaris pods. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/. |
| tracing.attributes | object | `{}` | Resource attributes to identify the polaris service among other tracing sources. See https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/resource/semantic_conventions/#service. If left empty, traces will be attached to a service named "Apache Polaris"; to change this, provide a service.name attribute here. |
| tracing.enabled | bool | `false` | Specifies whether tracing for the polaris server should be enabled. |
| tracing.endpoint | string | `"http://otlp-collector:4317"` | The collector endpoint URL to connect to (required). The endpoint URL must have either the http:// or the https:// scheme. The collector must talk the OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP) and the port must be its gRPC port (by default 4317). See https://quarkus.io/guides/opentelemetry for more information. |
| tracing.sample | string | `"1.0d"` | Which requests should be sampled. Valid values are: "all", "none", or a ratio between 0.0 and "1.0d" (inclusive). E.g. "0.5d" means that 50% of the requests will be sampled. Note: avoid entering numbers here, always prefer a string representation of the ratio. |
